        1.1    Introduction
 
        This manual describes how to install the "PLATO Lesson
        Delivery and Authoring System" application on your operating
        system.
 
        If the PLATO application media you ordered requires an
        upgrade of your operating system, we assume that that
        upgrade has already been installed.  This guide will only
        discuss the PLATO application installation.
 
        This manual has been written for system analysts and
        Engineering Services personnel who have a working knowledge
        of the hardware and software involved, including information
        in the operating system reference manual, the operating
        system operator's guide and the operating system analysis
        handbook.
 
        Other documentation for the PLATO application may be found
        in the following publications.
 
            PLATO Operations Guide             SMD 133345
            PLATO Installation Guide           SMD 133346
            PLATO Configuration Handbook       SMD 133347
            PLATO Software Release Bulletin    SMD 133348
 
        The Operations Guide for the PLATO application contains
        operations information.  The installing analyst should read
        the "PLATO Overview" section of the Operations Guide before
        starting the installation.
 
        The Configuration Handbook for the PLATO application contains
        information on setting up the configuration parameters which
        are referenced in this manual.
 
        The PLATO Software Release Bulletin for a particular release
        contains last-minute information about installations.  This
        document should be read before beginning the installation.
        Any conflicts between information contained in the SRB and
        the Installation Guide should be resolved in favor of the
        SRB.

        1.2    Operating System Compatibility
 
        Since the PLATO application is delivered as binaries which
        have been assembled for a specific level of the operating
        system, you must make sure that the PLATO Release you are
        installing is compatible with your operating system.
 
        Releasing the PLATO software as binaries on multiple levels
        of the operating system requires that there be different
        versions of the release materials.  These different versions
        are assembled for a specific NOS level and are not interchangable.
        For example, the PLATO Release 43 for NOS 2.7.1 level 739
        will not run on NOS 2.7.1 level 750 and vice versa.  If you
        are running PLATO Release 43 under NOS 2.7.1 level 739 and
        wish to upgrade your operating system, but continue to use
        the same PLATO Release, you must reorder the installation
        materials and reinstall the PLATO application.
 
        Each new PLATO Release will run under the most current level
        and the two most recent past levels of the operating system.
 
        Refer to the following charts for a presentation of the
        operating system and hardware dependencies of PLATO releases.

        1.2.3    Operating system changes
 
        The following section describes changes in the past several
        NOS releases which have required changes to the operation
        or installation of the PLATO application.  This is included
        to inform analysts performing an upgrade installation or
        reinstallation of the PLATO application of important changes
        in operational procedures.
 
        The following information highlights those NOS changes
        which may have the greatest impact on the PLATO application.
        Rather than duplicate other documentation on NOS, it
        describes areas of significance and cites references for
        further information.
 
        The most informative documents addressing NOS changes
        are the following:
 
             NOS Software Release Bulletin (SRB)
             NOS Feature Notes
             NOS V2 Installation Handbook (IHB)

        1.5    Where to Start
 
        Check to make sure that you have all the materials you will
        need for the installation.  Read the entire PLATO Software

        2.1    Introduction
 
        This section describes how to install the PLATO application
        for the first time.
 
        The following information will be asked of you during
        the installation procedures:
 
            - Your system routing identifier (RID).
 
              This is a unique identifier which has been assigned to
              your system by Control Data Software Manufacturing and
              Distribution.  You will find your RID on the CDC tape
              label affixed to each of your tapes.  The RID will be
              the last three characters of the "Customer Name"
              section of the tape.  For example:
 
                 CUSTOMER NAME                CFN NUMBER
                 SMITH COMPMNA                9315-00042222
 
                 In this example, the system RID is "MNA".
 
            - Your computer hardware configuration.
 
              This information will be used to determine installation
              procedures.
 
        For future reference, keep this information with your PLATO
        Operations guide.  It will also be required should you have
        to call or write for help with the PLATO application and
        when you order updates for the PLATO application.

        2.2    Determine disk system configuration.
 
        Before beginning the installation of the PLATO Lesson Authoring
        and Delivery application, you must decide how the disk packs
        to be used for the PLATO application will be defined.
 
        The NOS V2 Installation Handbook, the NOS V2 Reference Manual
        Volume 3 and the NOS V2 Analysis Handbook have information on
        how the disk system can be configured.
 
        The default disk system configuration uses the default family
        devices.  All release procedures are already configured for
        this disk system configuration.
 
        If you wish to use an alternate family for all PLATO files,
        you will have to modify the release procedures.  Each affected
        section will describe the changes which need to be made if you
        are using an alternate family for all PLATO files.
 
        You may also use either the default family or an alternate
        family for the PLATO application, but place the PLATO master
        files on auxilary devices.  Each affected section will describe
        the changes which need to be made if you are using auxiliary
        devices for the PLATO master files.
 
                                                 page   16
 
 
 
 
        2.3    Create PLATO system user name(s).
 
        Before you can create the PLATO system user name(s), the NOS
        validation files must be created.
 
        If you are using the default family for PLATO files, these
        validation files were created during the installation of the
        operating system.
 
        If you are using an alternate family for PLATO files, the
        NOS validation files for the family must be created.  This
        may be done by entering the following commands on the computer
        console:
 
                      X.DIS.
                      FAMILY(family name)
                      GENVAL.
                      DROP.
 
 
        To add required user names when using the default family,
        enter the following command on the computer console.
 
                      X.MODVAL.
 
        Or, if you are using an alternate family device for PLATO
        files, enter the following command on the computer console.
 
                      X.MODVAL(FM=fnam,OP=K)
 
        The MODVAL job will then request the K-display.  You must
        assign this display to the job by the following procedure.
 
            1.  Find the job which is requesting the K-display on
                the console B-display.
 
            2.  Note the job sequence number (JSN) of the job.  This
                is a four character identifier for the job.
 
            3.  Enter the following command on the computer console.
 
                      K,jsn.
 
        Using the MODVAL options documented in the NOS Administration
        Handbook, create the following user names.  Suggested names
        are given, but any legal NOS user name may be used.
 
             1.  A user name for PLATO system tasks (usually "sys").
 
             2.  A user name for PLATO print jobs (usually "prints").
 
        Give both user names all possible privileges (AW=ALL) and
        maximum resource limits (RL=ALL).  The validation mask
        parameter for these user names must be set to allow them to
        submit system service class jobs (VM=ALL).  The user index
        for these user names must be less than "auimx" (377700b).
 
                                                 page   17
 
 
 
 
 
        The PLATO application also requires the user names PLATOMF
        and SYSTEMX.  These user names were automatically created
        when the operating system was installed.
 
        The passwords for user names PLATOMF and SYSTEMX are needed
        later in this procedure.  They were set to "platomf" and
        "systemx", respectively, when the user names were created.
 
        User name PLATOMF is used when loading the PLATO master files.
        You must set the maximum resource limits (RL=ALL) for this
        user name.
 
        Once these steps have been completed, you will next obtain
        the PLATO application files from the installation tape.
 
                                                 page   18
 
 
 
 
        2.4    Obtain files from installation tape.
 
        This step will load the files which make up the PLATO
        application from the first installation tape.
 
        Mount the first installation tape (the one labeled PLAT1A)
        on an available tape drive.  Make sure the tape drive is
        available by checking the console E,T-display.
 
        Enter the following commands on the computer console:
 
                      X.DIS.
                      FAMILY(family name)  if using alternate family
                      USER(sys,password)   sys is the system user name
                                           created in the previous step
                      LABEL(TAPE,VSN=PLAT1A)
                      GTR(TAPE,INSTALL)PROC/INSTALL
                      BEGIN(INSTALL,INSTALL,PPW=ps1,SPW=ps2)
 
                      where  ps1 = password for user name PLATOMF
                                   (default = "platomf")
                             ps2 = password for user name SYSTEMX
                                   (default = "systemx")
 
        This procedure creates the following files.
 
            User sys:      PLABINS   PLATO release binaries
                           PLATOD    PLATO submit file

        See the PLATO Bill of Materials section for more information
        about these files.
 
        You will next modify the ASCII network to support the PLATO
        application.

        2.5    Modify the ASCII network.
 
        It is assumed that NAM and CCP or CDCNET have already been
        installed on any system which will be using the PLATO ASCII
        Network.  It is also assumed that the NAM configuration files
        (Network Definition Language (NDL) files) have been initialized
        so that terminals may be logged into NAM.
 
        This section describes changes which may be needed to the
        NAM configuration to allow the use of the PLATO application.
 
 
 
        2.5.1    Modify network configuration file.
 
        Make changes to the NAM network definition configuration
        file as described below:
 
            IST terminals are defined as type TTY (tc=m33).
 
            CDC-721 (Viking) terminals are defined as type 721
            (tc=721).
 
            Micro-computers used as PLATO terminals are defined as
            type TTY (tc=m33).
 
            In order to allow IST and Viking terminals to automatically
            load their resident, "pappl" must be set to "plato"
            ("pappl=plato").  You must also set "mfam" and "muser"
            for IST terminals.  If you fail to do this, the resident
            load sequence will be hung up at the NAM/NVF prompts for
            family/user name.  In addition, for IST terminals, you
            cannot enable auto-recognition.  Refer to the sample NDL
            file below for an example.
 
            Ensure that the NOS user names specified for the
            "muser" and "duser" parameters in the NDL source file,
            are validated for the "plato" application via MODVAL.
            If you are running on NOS 2.5.1 level 664 or higher,
            these user names must also have the concurrent access
            (CACA) and disable personal ID (COPI) bits set in the
            access word (AW) parameter of the validation file via
            MODVAL.

        2.5.1.1    Sample NDL file.
 
        For more information on the NDL and NDL Processor, refer to
        the NAM Network Definition Language Reference Manual.
 
        A sample program using NDL is shown below.  In this example,
        it is assumed that a NOS user name of "namnet" exists and
        is validated for access only to application "plato".
 
        In order for automatic loading of the terminal resident to
        occur, that line must have "pappl" set to "plato".
 
        Only the Viking Terminal is supported at 9600 baud.

        For more information on CDCNET Configuration, refer to the
        CDCNET Network Configuration and Site Administration Guide.
 
        A sample system configuration file is shown below.  In this
        example, it is assumed that the system is running on only
        one MTI (Mainframe/Terminal device Interface) unit.

        2.5.1.3    Sample CDCNET NDL local config
 
        In order for automatic loading of the terminal resident to
        occur, the line names defined with the "ln" parameter on the
        CDCNET system configuration "define_line" statement, should
        match lines defined in your NDL local definition configur-
        ation file.
 
        A sample program using NDL is shown below.  In this example,
        it is assumed that a NOS username of "namnet" exists and
        is validated for access only to application "plato".

        An example of a Terminal User Procedure (modified to work
        with PLATO) is shown below.  Notice that the procedure name
        is the same as the terminal user procedure parameter (tup)
        on the "define_line" statement in the system configuration
        file.

        2.5.2    Reinstall NAM and CCP.
 
        If you are using only CDCNET, you do not need to do anything
        with CCP as discussed in this section.  You still may need
        to reinstall NAM.
 
        Inspect the contents of files PLANAM and PLACCP under the
        PLATO system user name.  If either of these files contains
        modsets, it will be necessary to reinstall NAM and CCP
        with these modsets.  Refer to the NOS Installation Handbook
        for instructions.
 
        The PLATO application requires only the standard asynchronous
        TIP in the CCP build procedure.
 
        Save any modsets in PLANAM and PLACCP so they may be used
        again if NAM and CCP must be reinstalled in the future.
 
        You will next reinstall selected NOS programs.
 
                                                 page   29
 
 
 
 
        2.6    Reinstall selected NOS programs.
 
        Inspect the contents of file PLANOS under the PLATO system
        user name.  If this file contains modsets, it will be
        necessary to reinstall the affected programs with these
        modsets.  Refer to the NOS Installation Handbook for more
        information.
 
        By looking at the contents of this file, determine what NOS
        programs will need to be reassembled.  Only the programs
        which have modifications will need to be reassembled.
 
        Be sure that, any time in the future, when these programs
        are reassembled, that these modifications are included.
 
        Save the binaries produced for replacement on your deadstart
        file after all the PLATO materials are ready to be installed.
 
        Save any modsets in PLANOS so they may be used again if the
        affected NOS programs must be reinstalled in the future.
 
        You will next modify the system deadstart file text records.

        2.7    Modify deadstart file text records.
 
        The system deadstart file text records are used to define
        the configuration of your computer and its equipment and
        the operating system.
 
        You must make changes to the following deadstart text records
        to allow the PLATO application to function correctly.
 
                      CMRDECK
                      EQPDECK
                      LIBDECK
                      IPRDECK
 
        This can be done using O26 or some other text editor available
        on your system.  Instructions for using O26 may be found in
        the NOS V2 System Programmer's Instant manual.
 
        Save the modified text records for replacement on your dead-
        start file after all the PLATO materials are ready to be
        installed.
 
        Refer to the section titled "Deadstart File" in the PLATO
        Configuration Handbook for descriptions of the specific
        changes which must be made.
 
        The following examples assume you are using O26 as the text
        editor and that you are using the following copies of the
        text records: CMRD02, EQPD02, LIBD02, IPRD00.  The NOS
        Installation Handbook should be used to determine which text
        records should actually be used for your system.

        2.8    Modify release procedure files.
 
        The following files have been created under the PLATO system
        user name.
 
                      CONFIG
                      MFDX
                      MFNX

                      Z1DAILY
                      Z1ENDBC
 
        These files may require changes depending on the configuration
        of your system.  You may use O26 or any other text editor
        available on your system to make these changes.
 
        The following procedure may be used to modify these files.
 
                      X.DIS.
                      FAMILY(family name)  if using alternate family
                      USER(sys,password)
                      GET(file name)
                      O26.
                      READ.file name.
                      * make required changes.
                      DIS.
                      REPLACE(file name)
 
        The following sections describe the changes which may be
        required for each of these files.

        2.8.1    PLATO configuration file
 
        The following changes to your PLATO configuration file are
        required.  Refer to the PLATO Configuration Handbook for
        more information on the configuration file entries.
 
            1.  Change the "rid" entry to the routing identifier
                assigned to your system by Control Data.  See the
                section titled "Required Information" for instructions
                on how to determine your routing identifier.
 
            2.  You should change the "sid" entry to a name you
                wish your system to be known by.  This name may be
                a string of any alphanumeric characters of up to
                seven characters.
 
            3.  If you did not use "sys" as the PLATO system user
                name, you must change the "subun" entry to the user
                name actually used.
 
            4.  If you did not use "prints" as the PLATO print job
                user name, you must change the "prtun" entry to the
                user name actually used.
 
            5.  If you are using an alternate family for PLATO files,
                you must change the "famly" entry to the family name
                used.
 
        The following changes to your PLATO configuration file are
        recommended, but are not critical to the installation
        procedure.  These changes may be made now or at a later time.
 
            1.  If your mainframe is not a CYBER 180-810, you should
                change the "cpspd" entry to the recommended value
                for your mainframe.

        2.8.2    Procedure MFDX
 
        This procedure is used by the "backups" file dump procedure
        to copy master files to tape or disk.  See the PLATO Operations
        Guide for more information on this procedure.
 
        Initially, this procedure is set up to dump master files
        SYS1I and NEWINS.
 
        This file initially contains the following:

        The release procedure uses the system default tape density.
        If you wish to use a different density for master file dumps,
        you must add the "D" parameter to each of the COPYMF commands.
        Refer to the PLATO Operations Guide for information on using
        this parameter.

        2.8.3    Procedure MFNX
 
        This procedure file is called by the MASTOR job to attach
        all required PLATO master files.
 
        Initially, this file is set up to attach master files SYS1I,
        NEWINS, and BINARY.  These files will be loaded from the
        installation tapes or created in later steps of this
        installation procedure.
 
        This file initially contains the following:
 
                      .PROC,MFNX,M=R.
                      .*
                      .*        ATTACH PLATO MASTER FILES
                      .*
                      SETPUN.   SET PLATO USER NAME
                      .*
                      ATTACH(BINARY/:M=M)
                                    -    
                      ATTACH(SYS1I/:M=M)
                                   -    
                      ATTACH(NEWINS/:M=M)
                                    -    
                      .*
                      REVERT.
 
            The character ":" is the PLATO division sign or the
                           -                                   
            NOS equivalence symbol.  It is produced under O26 by
            using an upper case 0 (zero).
 
        If you are using an alternate family for PLATO master files,
        you must add a FAMILY command to this procedure.
 
        If you are using auxiliary devices for PLATO files, you must
        add the appropriate RESOURC and PACKNAM commands to this
        procedure.

        2.8.4    Submit file PLATOD
 
        This file contains calls to the CCL procedures on the system
        deadstart file which initiate the PLATO application jobs.  The
        release file contains the following.
 
                      NORERUN.
                      PLATX(CP=$+1$)  PLATO
                      FRAMX(CP=$+2$)  FORMATTER
                      PNIX(CP=$+3$)   PNI
                      CONDX(CP=$+4$)  CONDENSOR
                      EXIT.
 
        The "CP" argument of each procedure call indicates which
        control point is occupied by that PLATO job relative to the
        control point specified on the ENABLE,PLA entry you have
        added to the IPRDECK.
 
        The release submit file assumes that you have used a low-
        numbered control point for the ENABLE,PLA IPRDECK entry.  If
        you wish to use a high-numbered control point, you should
        modify the submit file to read as follows:
 
                      NORERUN.
                      PLATX(CP=$-1$)  PLATO
                      FRAMX(CP=$-2$)  FORMATTER
                      PNIX(CP=$-3$)   PNI
                      CONDX(CP=$-4$)  CONDENSOR
                      EXIT.
 
        Since the field length of the condensor is dynamic, it is
        best to keep it as the last control point to prevent storage
        moves for the other control points.
 
        The release submit file assumes there are four contiguous
        control points available following the control point specified
        by the ENABLE,PLA IPRDECK entry.  If this is not the case,
        you should modify the PLATO submit file to skip control
        points which are occupied by subsystems or change the control
        point assignments of other subsystems so there are four
        contiguous control points available.

        2.8.5    Procedure SETPUN
 
        This procedure file is called by several PLATO load jobs
        to set the PLATO user name, PLATOMF.
 
        Initially, this procedure uses the default password which
        was placed on user name PLATOMF when it was created and
        the default family.
 
        This file initially contains the following:
 
                      .PROC,SETPUN,PW=PLATOMF,FM=.
                      .*
                      .*      SET PLATO USER NAME.
                      .*
                      IFE(OT.NE.SYO,ORIGIN)
                      REVERT,ABORT.
                      ENDIF(ORIGIN)
                      .*
                      USER(PLATOMF,PW,FM)
                      .*
                      REVERT.
 
        If you are using a different password for user name PLATOMF
        or are using a different family, you must change the default
        values in the procedure header line to the actual values you
        are using.  This is necessary because the PLATO load jobs
        call this procedure without parameters.  Whenever you change
        the password for user name PLATOMF, you must also change this
        procedure so the PLATO load jobs will continue to work.

        2.8.6    Procedure Z1DAILY
 
        This procedure file is used by the PLATO Account Summaries
        option under "system options" in lesson "accounts".  Refer
        to the "Usage Tracking" section of the PLATO Operations Guide
        for more information.
 
        Initially, this procedure is set up to do the bare minimum
        of copying the reformatted data from dataset "z1data" to a
        NOS file under the default family, user name SYSTEMX, and
        the default system pack.  If you wish customize this procedure

        2.10    Initialize ESM.
 
        The PLATO application on 17x or 170-700 series mainframes
        uses either Extended Core Storage (ECS) or Extended Semi-
        conductor Memory (ESM) to store lesson material.  The 800
        series mainframes use Unified Extended Memory (UEM).  This
        section is only applicable to systems which use ESM.  Users
        of other types of memory should go on to the next step.
 
        ESM may be run in either ECS mode or ESM mode.  You should
        skip this section if you are using your ESM in ECS mode.
 
        Sites which will be using ESM should read the section titled
        "ESM Management" in the PLATO Configuration Handbook before
        proceeding with the installation of the PLATO application.
 
        ESM must be properly initialized using the following procedure
        before the PLATO application can be run.
 
            1.  Deadstart the system WITHOUT an ESM equipment (DE or
                DP) entry in the EQPDECK.
 
            2.  Create an indirect access file named ESMRM under
                NOS user name SYSTEMX.  This file is used to hold
                the relocation memory map.
 
            3.  Enter "X.ESM." at the computer console.
 
            4.  Assign the K-display to the job.
 
            5.  Enter "K.CONFIG." at the console.  This will initialize
                the relocation memory to your current ESM configuration.
 
            6.  Enter "K.GO." at the console.
 
            7.  Re-deadstart the system WITH the ESM equipment in
                the EQPDECK.
 
        You will next deadstart with the new deadstart file created
        earlier in this procedure.
 
                                                 page   44
 
 
 
 
        2.11    Deadstart on new deadstart file.
 
        You should now deadstart your system on the newly-created
        deadstart file.
 
        You will next load the release PLATO master files.
 
                                                 page   45
 
 
 
 
        2.12    Load PLATO master files.
 
        Use the PLATO procedure LOADMF to copy the PLATO master
        files from the installation tapes to disk.
 
        The formats of this procedure call are:
 
                      LOADMF(MF=mf)               default family
 
                      LOADMF(MF=mf,FAMILY=fn)     alternate family
 
                      LOADMF(MF=mf,PN=pn,R=dt)    auxiliary device
 
                 where:
 
                      mf  = master file name
                      fn  = family name
                      pn  = auxiliary pack name
                      dt  = device type if PN argument is used
 
        Mount each installation tape as it is requested via the
        E,P-display.
 
            Example:  Default family.
 
            If you are using the default family device for PLATO
            master files, enter the following on the computer console.
 
                      X.DIS.
                      USER(sys,password)
                      GET(LOADMF)
                      LOADMF(MF=SYS1I)
                      * press "." to execute.
                      * wait for this to finish.
                      LOADMF(MF=NEWINS)
                      * press "." to execute.
                      * wait for this to finish.
                      DROP.
 
 
            Example:  Alternate family.
 
            If you are using an alternate family device for PLATO
            master files, enter the following on the computer console.
 
                      X.DIS.
                      FAMILY(family name)
                      USER(sys,password)
                      GET(LOADMF)
                      LOADMF(MF=SYS1I,FAMILY=family name)
                      * press "." to execute.
                      * wait for this to finish.
                      LOADMF(MF=NEWINS,FAMILY=family name)
                      * press "." to execute.
                      * wait for this to finish.
                      DROP.
 
                                                 page   46
 
 
 
 
 
            Example:  Auxiliary devices.
 
            To load the PLATO master files onto an auxiliary device,
            enter the following on the computer console.
 
                      X.DIS.
                      FAMILY(family name)  if using alternate family
                      USER(sys,password)
                      GET(LOADMF)
                      LOADMF(MF=SYS1I,PN=pack name,R=device type)
                      * press "." to execute.
                      * wait for this to finish.
                      LOADMF(MF=NEWINS,PN=pack name,R=device type)
                      * press "." to execute.
                      * wait for this to finish.
                      DROP.
 
        You will next create the binary master file.
 
                                                 page   47
 
 
 
 
        2.13    Create binary master file.
 
        Use the PLATO utility MFCREAT to create a binary master
        file.  See the PLATO Operations Guide for more information
        about the MFCREAT utility.
 
        The customary name for this master file is BINARY.  If you
        wish to use a different name, you must change the name of
        the binary master file attached in procedure MFNX.
 
        You should use the default size for this file for the
        device type on which it is being created.  If this causes
        a track limit error, run the procedure again, using the SP
        parameter of the MFCREAT command to create a smaller master
        file.
 
            Example:  Default family.
 
                      X.DIS.
                      USER(PLATOMF,password)
                      PURGE(BINARY/NA)
                      MFCREAT(MF=BINARY,PT=BINARY)
                      DROP.
 
 
            Example:  Alternate family.
 
                      X.DIS.
                      USER(PLATOMF,password)
                      FAMILY(family name)
                      PURGE(BINARY/NA)
                      MFCREAT(MF=BINARY,PT=BINARY)
                      DROP.
 
 
            Example:  Auxiliary device.
 
                      X.DIS.
                      USER(PLATOMF,password)
                      PACKNAM(pack name)
                      PURGE(BINARY/NA,R=device type)
                      MFCREAT(MF=BINARY,PT=BINARY,DT=device type)
                      DROP.
 
 
        You will next load the PLATO application.

        2.14    Load PLATO via PLAINS.
 
        You will now load the PLATO application via the PLAINS
        DSD-command.
 
        1.   If your system is to use the PLATO ASCII network, NAM
             must be brought up at this point.
 
        2.   Load the PLATO application by entering the following on
             the computer console.
 
                      PLAINS.
 
             When PLATO (job "PLA1") first comes up, the following
             system dayfile message will be seen:
 
                      ERROR - SYSTEM ID .NE. ROUTING ID
                             SYSTEM ID =
                            ROUTING ID = *rid*
 
             where "rid" is the routing identifier for your system as
             set by the value of the "rid" configuration file keyword.
 
             This message appears because the system routing identifer
             has not yet been set.  This will be done as the first step
             of the system file initialization later in this procedure.
 
             The following system dayfile message will also be seen:
 
                      SYSTEM *sid* NOT IN NETWORK TABLE
 
             where "sid" is the name of your system you chose for
             the value of the "sid" configuration file keyword.
 
             This message appears because there is no entry in the
             network system table for your system.  This will be done
             as the second step of the system file initialization
             later in this procedure.
 
             Following this message, another error message will be
             seen:
 
                      (S0INIT)  ERROR IN CWARE ACCESS COMMON
 
             This message indicates that there is no published
             courseware on the system.  The file containing the
             courseware access limit common will be delivered
             with the first published courseware shipment.  If no
             published courseware is to be available on a system,
             this message will be seen every time the application
             is brought up.  This message should be ignored.
 
 
        You will next initialize PLATO system files.

        2.15    Initialize system files.
 
        During the following system file initialization, you will
        be working with PLATO lessons which have been designed to
        prompt you through their use.  This prompting is accomplished
        through the use of "arrows" where input is requested and
        through function key prompts (such as NEXT, BACK, LAB, etc).
 
        Some important ideas to keep in mind about function keys:
 
        1.  Function keys also have upper-case (shifted) versions
            such as SHIFT-NEXT.  These are produced by holding down
            the SHIFT key and pressing the desired function key.
 
        2.  When entering data at an arrow, you usually must press
            NEXT following the input, unless the data is only one
            character in length (such as choosing an option on an
            index or menu).
 
        3.  When entering data at an arrow which requires an extra
            measure of caution (such as destroying a file), you may
            be required to press SHIFT-HELP instead of NEXT.
 
        4.  NEXT usually takes you "forward" in a PLATO lesson while
            BACK usually takes you "backward".  SHIFT-NEXT and SHIFT-
            BACK may take you forward or backward in larger jumps.
 
        5.  On many displays, the HELP key may be used to see a more
            detailed description of available options.
 
        6.  The SHIFT-STOP key is used to exit from any lesson back
            to the AUTHOR MODE display.
 
 
        At this time, using a PLATO terminal, sign into the PLATO
        application with the following sign-on information.
 
                     PLATO name:     "install"
                     PLATO group:    "p"
                     password:       "install"

        2.15.1    Installation parameters
 
        Set system installation parameters.
 
        1.  Set the system identifier as follows:
 
            a.  Enter the lesson name "ipedit" on the AUTHOR MODE
                display as shown in Figure 1a.  Press DATA after
                the name to begin execution of the lesson.  This
                procedure will be referred to as "executing lesson
                "ipedit"" later in this document.
 
            b.  From the first display of options (shown in Figure
                1b), choose the "Network management" option.
 
            c.  On the next display (shown in Figure 1c), choose the
                "System Identifier" option.
 
            d.  Take note of the WARNING (as shown in Figure 1d) that
                you are given regarding the assignment of the system
                identifier.  After reading the warning, press NEXT.
 
            e.  Set the System Identifier (RID discussed earlier).
                It must match the "rid" PLATO configuration file
                entry and must NEVER be changed after it has been
                entered for the first time.
 
            f.  Once you have set the system identifier, press BACK
                once to return to the "Network management" display
                (Figure 1c).
 
        2.  Add your system to the network system table.
 
            a.  Choose the "System Table" option.  This takes you to
                the "Network System Table Management" display (Figure
                1f).
 
            b.  Choose the "Add a new system to the table" option.
 
            c.  On the next display, enter your system name.  This
                must match the "sid" PLATO configuration file entry.
 
            d.  On the next display, choose the "Directly connected
                by PCN" option.  This is done so the AUTHORS database
                may be used on your system.
 
            e.  On the next display (Figure 1e), choose the "routing
                identifier" option and enter your system RID.  This
                must match the "rid" configuration file entry and
                the system identifier entered in step 1 of this section.
 
            f.  Also on this display, choose the "Authors database
                availability" option to toggle this flag to "on".
 
        3.  Return to the "Network System Table Management" index
            (Figure 1f) and choose the "Update the EM copy of the
 
                                                 page   51
 
 
 
            system table" option.  Press SHIFT-HELP when instructed
            to do so.
 
        4.  Now press BACK to return to the main index of
            "Installation Parameters" ("ipedit") shown in Figure 1b
            and set the remaining desired values.  Most, if not all,
            of the parameters should be adequate for the time being.
 
        5.  After setting all desired installation parameters, press
            SHIFT-STOP to return to the Author Mode display.
 
 
        You are now ready to initialize the EM allocation tables.

        2.15.2    EM allocation tables
 
        When your system is first brought up, two logical sites,
        named "network" and "system", have already been created
        with a minimum amount of extended memory allocated to them
        to allow you to sign on and initialize the system files.
        In this step, you will allocate additional extended memory
        to logical site "network" for use by other users.
 
        1.  Execute lesson "allocate".
 
        2.  Choose the "Special Functions" option.
 
        3.  On the next display, choose the "Initialize EM Tables"
            option.
 
        4.  Press SHIFT-HELP when requested.
 
        5.  When the initialization has completed, you will be
            returned to the main index.  Press SHIFT-STOP to leave
            lesson "allocate".
 
 
        You are now ready to initialize the system groups.

        2.15.3    System groups
 
        The following functional groups are to be considered for the
        following steps.
 
                      p   = Controllers
                      o   = Operations
                      pso = Consultants
                      m   = Communications
 
        Add sign-ons as needed to these groups using the following
        procedure.
 
                                  NOTE
 
                   Be sure to add yourself to group "p".
 
 
         1. Enter the name of the group you wish to edit on the
            Author Mode display and press NEXT.
 
         2. On the first display you see (Figure 2a), select the
            "Roster operations" option by pressing NEXT.
 
         3. On the Roster Operations display (Figure 2b), choose the
            "Add someone to the roster" option.
 
         4. You will be asked to choose the type of record you wish
            to create (Figure 2c).  Choose to create an "author" sign-on.
 
         5. On the next display (Figure 2d), you will be asked to type
            the name of the new author.
 
         6. You will then be prompted for a password (twice, to make
            sure you have entered it correctly), and an expiration
            date.
 
         7. Press DATA to edit this user's sign-on.  You should see
            a display resembling Figure 2e.
 
         8. Choose the "choose allowable author OPTIONS" option.
            You will be shown a display which will allow you to

                "psonotes"
                "sysln"
                "s0sysmsg"
 
        To change the access for a notes file, do the following:
 
        1.  Enter the name of the notes file you wish on the Author
            Mode display and press NEXT.
 
        2.  From the main display of the notes file, press SHIFT-DATA
            for the notes file director options.
 
        3.  If someone has used the director options before you, you
            will see a display giving the information about who has
            used an option.  Press NEXT to go to the Director Options
            display.
 
        4.  Press NEXT to inspect or change the access list.
 
        5.  You will now see a display titled "Notes Access Options"
            (Figure 3a).  Press NEXT to see or edit access for people
            on the same system as the notes file.
 
        6.  On the "Local" system display (Figure 3b), enter the
            group or account for which you wish to inspect or change
            the access, and press NEXT.
 
        7.  On the next display, you may see a list of user types.
            Choose the user type for which you wish to inspect or

            user type "Other" to edit the access for all unlisted
            user types.
 
        8.  You will now have several options to grant privileges to
            users of the notes file (Figure 3c).  You may select upper
            case (SHIFTed) letters to set the associated flags, or
            you may press individual lower case letters corresponding
            to the privileges you wish to grant.

        2.15.6    Central print options
 
        This section describes how to customize the jobs submitted
        through the central system print request lesson, "prints".
        The jobs submitted by lesson "prints" are initially set to
        use an upper case only print train.  You will need to use
        this procedure only if you wish to use a different print
        train, or do something special with user-requested prints.
        If you do not wish to change the default print types, go on
        to the next step, customizing the AIDS package.
 
         1. Edit file "prtsub".
 
         2. Customize the procedures in the following blocks only
            if you wish to do something special with prints.  Other-
            wise, you may continue with step 4.
 
                 -  "upperlower" = upper/lower case prints
                 -  "upper case" = upper case only prints
 
         3. Press BACK until you have returned to the Author Mode
            display.
 
         4. Execute lesson "prints".
 
         5. On the next display, you may see a message which says
            "There are no prints to do".  If this is the case, press
            NEXT to go to the "Print Requests" options (Figure 4a).
            Otherwise, you will see a page which shows options to
            press SHIFT-DATA and SHIFT-LAB (Figure 4b).  These options
            are used when you are actually going to request a print,
            and wish to use a different format from the default format.
            On this display, press SHIFT-BACK for the "Print Requests"
            options, as shown in Figure 4a.
 
         6. If you wish to change the print train, choose the "Print
            Log MAINTENANCE" option.
 
         7. On the next display (Figure 4c), choose the "Setup Print
            Types" option.
 
         8. On the next display (Figure 4d), choose the print type
            which you wish to change.
 
         9. Enter a description of the print type.
 
        10. Enter the names of the file and block to be submitted
            for this print type.
 
        11. When you are done entering print types, press BACK.
 
        12. Now return to the Log Maintenance index (Figure 4c) and
            customize any other desired parameters on the index.
 
 
        You are now ready to customize the AIDS package.

        2.15.7    AIDS package
 
        You should edit the contents of the blocks in the following
        "aids" files to contain specific information about your
        system:
 
                   a0psoless
                   a0ss1
 
        You are now ready to customize the AUTHORS package.

        2.15.8    AUTHORS package
 
        Create an AUTHORS database for your system as follows:
 
        1.  Execute lesson "authors".  You will see a display
            informing you that "authors" is turned off.  On this
            display, press SHIFT-DATA for the director options.
 
        2.  On the next display, you will see a message informing
            you of a "FATAL error in lesson authors" which gives
            the name of a file which does not exist.  The following
            procedure will create and initialize this file.  On this
            display, press SHIFT-NEXT to initialize the authors
            database.
 
        3.  When asked about expected values for the database, the
            numbers you enter are not critical at this time.  They
            may be changed later.
 
        4.  When the database initialization is complete, you will
            be taken to the AUTHORS director options display.  On
            this display, press DATA for the system information
            display.
 
        5.  You will be presented with four options which you may
            change if desired.  You MUST choose the second option
            to toggle it to read "AUTHORS is on".
 
        6.  When you are done, press BACK twice to go to the main
            "Directory of PLATO Authors" display.
 
        7.  Press SHIFT-STOP to return to the AUTHOR MODE display.
 
 
        You are now ready to install optional features.

        2.16    Install optional features.
 
        There are several optional features which may or may not be
        initialized depending on the resources available and the
        desire for the feature.  Some of these features are NOT
        available on all systems.
 
        These optional features may be installed during the initial
        system installation or at any time afterward.
 
        See the "Optional Installation Procedures" section for more
        information and procedures to initialize these optional features.
 
        If you do not wish to install any of these optional features
        at this time, or, after completing the installation of all
        desired optional features, you should continue with the Post-
        Installation Cleanup, as described in the following section.

        2.17.2    Run account cleanup programs.
 
        Run an account cleanup on all accounts on the system.  This
        procedure involves the following:
 
        1. Execute lesson "accountu".
 
        2. Choose the "update an account file name table" option.
 
        3. Choose "b" for more processing time.
 
        4. Press NEXT to build a new list of files.
 
        5. After the list of files has been sorted, you will be
           prompted for an account name.  Press SHIFT-NEXT to
           process all accounts.
 
        6. Press SHIFT-HELP to start the process.
 
                               NOTE
 
                   The process can be very lengthy
                   depending on how many master files
                   are on your system.
 
        7. When the word "DONE" appears, press SHIFT-STOP to return

        2.17.4    Convert master files.
 
        These procedures are not critical.  The PLATO application
        will work correctly if these procedures are not done until
        some time in the future.
 
        You may want to rename your master files to use a naming
        convention which is popular at other sites.
 
        To rename master files SYS1I and NEWINS to SYSTEM and AMAST,
        do the following:
 
        1.  Take the PLATO application down.
 
        2.  Execute the following job at the computer console.
 
                      X.DIS.
                      FAMILY(family name)  if using alternate family
                      USER(PLATOMF,password)
                      PACKNAM(pack name)  if using auxiliary devices
                      CHANGE(SYSTEM=SYS1I)
                      CHANGE(AMAST=NEWINS)
                      ATTACH(SYSTEM,AMAST/M=W)
                      MFALTER(MF=SYSTEM,N=SYSTEM)
                      MFALTER(MF=AMAST,N=AMAST)
                      DROP.
 
        4.  Change procedure MFNX on the current deadstart file to
            change the master file names.
 
        5.  Change procedure MFDX on the current deadstart file to
            change the master file names.
 
        6.  Make a new deadstart file with the changed MFNX and MFDX
            procedures and reload the system with it.
 
        7.  Bring up the PLATO application.
 
        8.  Rename the master files in the required master files
            table in lesson "ipedit".
 
        9.  Use program BACKMOD to rename the master files in the
            list of master files to be dumped.
 
 
        If you wish to expand the disk space available for user
        files on your system, you may do one of the following:
 
           - Add another required master file to your system.  Refer
             to the "Adding/Changing a Required Master File" section
             of the PLATO Configuration Handbook for information on
             how to do this.
 
           - Use procedure MFPACK to increase the size of the existing
             type general master file.  This would permit you to
             take better advantage of the capacity of the master file
 
                                                 page   67
 
 
 
             directories.  In order to do this, you may have to add
             another disk pack to your system.
 
             The following example assumes you have renamed master
             file NEWINS to AMAST.  The SP parameter given in the
             example is the maximum size for a master file on an
             834 (DD) device.  If your master file is on a different
             device type, use the maximum for that device given in
             the section describing the MFCREAT command in the PLATO
             Operations Guide.
 
             1.  Take the PLATO application down.
 
             2.  Increase the size of the master file by executing
                 one of the following jobs at the computer console.

        2.18    Install published courseware.
 
        The initial shipment of new courseware to your site will be
        composed of any or all of the following courseware Categories:
 
             Category I   - Academic (Libraries A/B)
             Category II  - Authors Library
             Category III - Educational (Libraries C/E/G/H/M and LDEC)
             Category IV  - Training (Libraries D/F/I/J/K/L)
 
        The tapes containing the courseware will be labeled as follows:
 
             Category I   - cat1a / cat1b / cat1c / ...
             Category II  - cat2a / ...
             Category III - cat3a / ...
             Category IV  - cat4a / ...
 
        In addition, the initial shipment will include a site-specific
        tape, whose label will correspond to the site name.  It contains
        the published courseware catalog (accessed by pressing shifted
        "F" from the Author Mode display) and the file that holds the
        courseware access limit for your site.  This limit is the
        maximum number of users who may simultaneously be accessing
        published courseware.  This tape also contains other course-
        ware management work files.
 
             NOTE:  The courseware access limit will not take effect
                    until (1) the site-specific tape has been in-
                    stalled, and (2) the PLATO application has been
                    taken down and brought back up, since the limit
                    is read in and set only at that time.  Until
                    then, nobody will be able to access any of the
                    courseware.
 
        If your site has ordered courseware by title, rather than by
        entire Categories, the initial shipment tapes tapes will be
        labeled like the site-specific tape: "site1", "site2", etc.
 
        For every tape received, there will be an accompanying
        MFPRINT, listing all the files within that master file tape.
 
        Regardless of the tape labels and the contents, each tape
        contains a single, 2000-part master file.  The method for
        installing the courseware involves adding each master file
        as a required master file and performing account clean up
        procedures.
 
        The following steps should be followed for all tapes EXCEPT
        the site-specific tape, which should be installed as described
        in the "Courseware Installation" section of the PLATO Operations
        Guide after all other tapes have been installed.  These steps
        are described in more detail in the following sections.
 
 
        a.   Ensure sufficient disk space under NOS.
 
 
                                                 page   69
 
 
 
        b.   Copy all tapes to disk via MFTLOAD.
 
        c.   Use the procedure described in the "Changing a Required
             Master File" section of the PLATO Configuration Hand-
             book to change the master file name and the master file
             type for all the newly-copied courseware master files.
 
        d.   Execute the "Search for duplicate files" option of
             lesson "installu".
 
        e.   Execute the "Update account file name table" option of
             lesson "accountu".
 
        f.   Execute the "Account directory and file checks" option
             of lesson "accountu".
 
        g.   Execute the "Search for files not in an account" option
             of lesson "accountu".
 
        h.   Install the site-specific tape as described in the
             "Courseware Installation" section of the PLATO Operations
             Guide.
 
 
 
        2.18.1    Courseware installation - details
 
        The following is a detailed explanation of each of the steps
        described above:
 
        a.  "Ensure sufficient disk space under NOS."
 
             A single disk part is 35 sectors, so each 2000-part
             master file will occupy 70,000 sectors.  The number of
             free tracks required for each master file on each
             supported device type is shown below.  The following
             table gives the number of free tracks assuming you are
             using single-spindle devices.  If you are using multi-
             spindle devices, divide the required free tracks by the
             number of spindles in the device to be used.
 
                      DC         144b tracks
                      DD         667b tracks
                      DG         175b tracks
                      DI        1217b tracks
                      DJ         465b tracks
                      DK        1161b tracks
                      DL         465b tracks
                      DM         156b tracks
                      DQ         156b tracks
 
             If you received more courseware than there is room for
             on your system, please contact your sales representative.
             Your representative should then, in turn, call PLATO
             Courseware Delivery to discuss the resolution of this
             problem.
 
 
                                                 page   70
 
 
 
        b.  "Copy all tapes to disk via MFTLOAD."
 
             Refer to the PLATO Operations Guide for details on how
             to use MFTLOAD to copy master file tapes to disk.
 
        c.   "Use the procedure described in the "Changing a Required
             Master File" section of the PLATO Configuration Hand-
             book to change the master file name and the master file
             type for all the newly-copied courseware master files."
 
             Using MFALTER (refer to the PLATO Operations Guide for
             details), change the master file names from names like
             "cat1a", etc., to a name similar to others in use on
             your system.  Traditionally, the names "amast", "bmast",
             etc., have been used.  In addition, to ensure the proper
             operation of your system, the first four (4) letters of
             all master file names must be unique.
 
             At the same time as each master file name is being
             changed, its type should be changed to "general".
 
        d.  "Execute the "Search for duplicate files" option of
             lesson "installu"."
 
             The way the various Categories are built is such that
             each of them is self-sufficient, as opposed to requi-
             ring that a different Category also be installed.  For
             this reason, it is necessary to delete any duplicate
             files that may exist on your system.  The steps to
             follow are:
 
             1.   Execute lesson "installu".
 
             2.   Select the "Search for duplicate files" option.
 
             3.   At the arrow, just press SHIFT-NEXT, to indicate
                  that all master files are to be searched.
 
             You will then see each master file name displayed, and
             every 64th file shown.  Should a duplicate be encoun-
             tered, you will be shown the information for each file
             (account, last edit info, master file, length, etc.).
             Based on that information, with primary consideration
             of the last edit date/time and the master file of resi-
             dence (the copy of the file on the earlier-numbered
             master file will be the copy accessed by users), press
             either SHIFT-HELP or SHIFT-DATA to delete one file or
             the other.
 
             Follow this procedure until all duplicate files have
             been deleted, before proceeding to the next step.
 
 
        2.18.2    Courseware installation - details
 
        e.  "Execute the "Update account file name table" option of
             lesson "accountu"."
 
                                                 page   71
 
 
 
 
             This step is performed to update the directories of all
             accounts on the system so that they accurately represent
             the file and space count for the files in each account.
 
             The procedure to be performed is as follows.
 
             1.   Reload the PLATO application using the PLAINS
                  command or turn off file management options through
                  lesson "account1".
 
             2.   Execute lesson "accountu".
 
             3.   Choose the "Update an account file name table"
                  option.
 
             4.   Press "b" to indicate that processing is to be
                  done in "background" mode (gives more processing
                  time).
 
             5.   Press NEXT to "build a new list of files".
 
             6.   After the list is built and sorted, you will be
                  given the option to press SHIFT-NEXT to process
                  all accounts.  Do so.
 
             7.   Press SHIFT-HELP to start the process.  When com-
                  pleted, the screen will erase and the message
                  "DONE" will appear.
 
        f.  "Execute the "Account directory and file checks" option
             of lesson "accountu"."
 
             This option checks each file on the system, and
             sets the published flag, if the account is published,
             and resets the account ordinal in the file directory.
             Before actually performing the steps, it might be of
             use to press HELP from within this option to see the
             list of features, followed by a list of the possible
             errors and what to do in case of each.
 
             The steps to be followed are:
 
             1.   From the index of "accountu", choose the "Account
                  directory and file checks" option.
 
             2.   Press "b" to indicate that processing is to be
                  done in "background" mode (gives more processing
                  time).
 
             3.   On the following display, choose the options as
                  follows:
 
                    File space computation?       y
                    NL space computation?         n
                    Directory pointer check?      y
                    Log errors in datafile?       y (see below)
 
                                                 page   72
 
 
 
                    Display errors on screen?     n (see below)
 
                  NOTE:  Since this process will take a long time,
                  it is assumed that you will not want to stand
                  by and wait for an error to be encountered, but
                  rather that you will examine the error log (file
                  "accerrlog") after processing, to see if any errors
                  were encountered.
 
             4.   When prompted for an account name, press NEXT
                  with no input, to indicate that all accounts are
                  to be processed.
 
             5.   You will then be given the choice of pressing NEXT
                  to begin processing or SHIFT-HELP to clear the
                  datafile.  Press SHIFT-HELP.
 
             When all accounts have been processed, the message
             "COMPLETED" will be displayed.  At that point, check
             the log ("accerrlog") to see what kinds of problems
             may have come up.  To find out how to correct them,
             refer back to the HELP sequence.  If there were no
             errors, looking at "accerrlog" will show that 0 blocks
             are in use; otherwise, you will be given the option to
             look through the file contents.
 
 
        2.18.3    Courseware installation - details
 
        g.  "Execute the "Search for files not in an account" option
             of lesson "accountu"."
 
             This option involves going through each master file on
             the system, and logging every file that does not appear
             in the "list of files" prepared earlier.  Seeing as the
             existing files/accounts are all in accordance with each
             other, the only files that show up in this search will
             be those which indicate they are in non-existent accounts.
             The steps to follow are:
 
             1.   Choose the "Search for files not in any account"
                  option from the main index of "accountu".
 
                  (From this point, you may wish to press HELP to
                  get a more detailed explanation of what this op-
                  tion does.)
 
             2.   Press "b" to indicate that processing is to be
                  done in "background" mode (gives more processing
                  time).
 
             3.   If you feel certain of the integrity of the
                  earlier-built list of files, press SHIFT-NEXT
                  to proceed; otherwise, press NEXT to build and
                  sort a new list.
 
             4.   Assuming that all problems previously logged in
 
                                                 page   73
 
 
 
                  "accerrlog" have been resolved, press SHIFT-HELP
                  when prompted to initialize the datafile.
 
             You will then see a display where each master file name
             will be plotted, and then every "offending" file name
             shown, along with the alleged account name.  Since the
             displayed entries are being logged, there is no need to
             watch/record the file names as they appear.
 
             When processing is complete, the message "DONE" will be
             displayed at the bottom of the display.
 
             As indicated in the HELP sequence, problem files should
             be moved into legitimate accounts via "account1".

        This concludes the initial installation of courseware on
        your system.

        There are several optional features of the PLATO Lesson
        Delivery and Authoring System which may be initialized
        depending on the resources available and the desire for
        the feature.  Some of these features are NOT available
        on all systems.
 
        These optional features may be initialized during the initial
        system installation or at any time afterward.
 
        See the following sections for more information and procedures
        to initialize these optional features.

        3.1    Archiving
 
        Please read the section in the PLATO Operations Guide which
        describes the Archiving Utility and its operation.
 
        The archiving utilities are included in the software sent
        to every system.  To use this feature on your system,
        install as follows:
 
        1.  Set the warning and deletion cycles for archive files
            as follows:
 
            a.  Execute lesson "ipedit".
 
            b.  Choose option "archive recycle period".
 
            c.  Enter settings as desired.
 
            d.  Press SHIFT-STOP to exit "ipedit".
 
        2.  Create file "s0archds" according to the specifications
            given in the PLATO Bill of Materials section of this
            document.
 
        3.  Execute lesson "archiver".  It will prompt for
            initialization when executed the first time.  Press
            SHIFT-NEXT to initialize.
 
        4.  Enable the archive feature as follows:
 
            a.  Execute lesson "account1".
 
            b.  Choose "file backup and archive options".
 
            c.  If archiving is currently disallowed, choose the
                option to "allow archiving".
 
        Before an account can use the archiving utility, it must
        be assigned "archive rights".  See the PLATO Operations
        Guide for instructions on how to do this.

        3.2    Backups
 
        Please read the section in the PLATO Operations Guide which
        describes the Backups Utility and its operation.
 
        The Backup procedure BACKDMP requires that SORT5 be available
        on the system.
 
        The procedure to initialize the Backups utility for use is
        described below.
 
        1.  Use the procedure "Setting Up Dump Directory Datasets"
            in the PLATO Operations Guide to set up 6 datasets.
 
        2.  Create file "s0backa" according to the specifications
            given in the PLATO Bill of Materials section of this
            document.
 
        3.  Create file "s0backc" according to the specifications
            given in the PLATO Bill of Materials section of this
            document.
 
        4.  Run the following job at the console:
 
                      X.BACKMOD.
                      K,jsn.
                      K.INITIALIZE
                      K.WR
                      K.END
                      X.BACKCPY.
 
        5.  Use the procedure "Initializing the Slot Table" in the
            PLATO Operations Guide to set up the desired dump cycle.
 
        6.  Use the "Changing the Master Files to be Dumped"
            procedure in the PLATO Operations Guide to initialize
            the list of master files you wish to dump.  You should
            add master files SYS1I and NEWINS to this list.

        3.3    Central Micro PLATO executor
 
        The Central Micro PLATO Executor (CMP) allows lessons written
        in the Micro PLATO Language to be executed on the central
        system.  It aids in development of lessons written in the
        Micro PLATO Language, but also increases the amount of EM
        used as overhead by the PLATO system, reducing the amount
        of EM available for user lessons.
 
        To install the Micro PLATO Executor:
 
        1.  Add the following to the PLATO configuration file:
 
                      cmp=on.
 
        2.  Create file "s0cmp0" according to the specifications
            given in the PLATO Bill of Materials section of this
            document.
 
        3.  Edit file "s0cmp0".
 
        4.  Press DATA to edit the file information.
 
        5.  Choose the "associated files" option.
 
        6.  Set the -use- file to "s0cmpuse".
 
        7.  Press BACK to return to the file information index.
 
        8.  Choose the "Micro PLATO level" option.
 
        9.  Set the Micro PLATO level to "3" and the execution mode
            to "Central System execution".
 
        10. If you are using more than one condensor, repeat this
            procedure for files "s0cmp1" and "s0cmp2".

        3.4    Network database
 
        A network database describing all aspects of your communi-
        cations network may be built using lesson "pnet".  This
        database may be quickly scanned to aid in the isolation
        of network problems.
 
        A HELP-section in lesson "pnet" provides additional
        information.
 
        The network database is built via options in "pnet" as
        follows:
 
        1.  Enter all locations in the location table.
 
        2.  Enter all equipment types in the equipment table.
 
        3.  Enter all terminal types in the terminal type table.
 
        4.  Define any desired utility fields.
 
        5.  Add all circuits and rotaries in your network.  As
            each entry is made, add all known information to the
            corresponding information fields.

        3.5    Computer Interface Unit network
 
        The CIU (Central Interface Unit) and SIU (Site Interface
        Unit) are unique to the PLATO application.  This network
        is not available on CYBER 170-800 series machines.
 
        1.  Add the CI and D2 EQPDECK entries.  See the PLATO
            Configuration Handbook for more information.
 
        2.  Add / Change the following entries in the PLATO
            configuration file.
 
                c0sit
                c1sit
                nc0si
                nc1si
 
 
        Lesson "ciudiag" is the CIU diagnostics utility.  If you
        wish to use this optional feature, do the following:
 
        1.  Create file "s0ciuna" according to the specifications
            given in the PLATO Bill of Materials section of this
            document.
 
        2.  Execute lesson "s0ciuin" and execute all initialization
            options.
 
        3.  Add the following to the runner list according to the
            specifications given in the PLATO Configuration Hand-
            book.
 
                s0ciuru

        3.6    TRANSMIT Utility
 
        The TRANSMIT Utility allows users to transfer data from
        PLATO files into NOS files for batch jobs to process.
 
        To install TRANSMIT, the following steps should be followed:
 
        1.   One or more datasets must be created for use in trans-
             ferring data.  These files should be created in account
             "s0files", and have the following characteristics:
 
                  record size:   64 words
                  length:        minimum of 10 parts.  Performance
                                 improves as the length approaches
                                 63 parts.  (The length determines
                                 how many separate batch jobs must
                                 be submitted to transfer the files
                                 to NOS files.)
 
             The number of datasets created determines how
             many users can use TRANSMIT simultaneously.  Any number
             from one to 60 is acceptable, assuming sufficient sys-
             tem resources are available.
 
        2.   Enter the names of all datasets created in leslist
             "s0xmit" in file "s0common".
 
        3.   Enable the use of TRANSMIT on the system:
 
             a.   Execute lesson "ipedit".
 
             b.   Choose the "batch submission control" option.
 
             c.   Edit the appropriate mainframe entries to enable
                  both the "User jobs" and "Transmit" features on
                  the desired mainframe(s).
 
        Accounts must be allowed to use this utility.  See the
        "TRANSMIT" section in the PLATO Operations Guide for more
        information on how to do this.

        3.7    PLATO Inter-System Link
 
        Before beginning the installation of the PLATO Inter-System
        Link optional product, please read the overview given in the
        PLATO Operations Guide.
 
        Before you install the PLATO Inter-System Link, you must
        first install both the PLATO (level 34.2 or higher) and RHP
        applications.
 
        The RHP installation process is described in the NOS Ver-
        sion 2 Installation Handbook.  Be sure to specify "NAM" as
        the supporting network when building the application.  Also,
        you must include the modifications delivered on the PLAT1A
        PLATO release tape and placed into NOS file PLARHP by the
        INSTALL or UPGRADE PLATO installation procedure.
 
        The following is a list of the steps to be taken to install
        the PLATO Inter-system Link.  Each of the numbered steps is
        discussed in detail in the following sections.
 
               Install the PLATO application on your operating
               system.
 
               Install (or re-install) the RHP application
               using any modsets in file PLARHP.
 
            1. Determine accounting method to be used.
 
            2. Create NOS user names.
 
            3. Modify the network configuration file.
 
            4. Modify the PLATO network system table.
 
            5. Create required system-specific files.
 
            6. Install the required runner programs.
 
        3.7.1    Determine accounting method
 
        Read the "Link accounting" section of the PLATO Configuration
        Handbook and decide which method of accounting for link traffic
        you wish to use for your system.  This will affect the
        information you must enter into the PLATO network system table
        for each linked system.
 
        3.7.2    Create NOS user names
 
        You need to set up two NOS user names that are used to
        transfer data between systems.  Follow these steps:
 
        1.  You have the option of placing your link data files
            on an alternate family device.
 
            If you wish to use an alternate family, the NOS
 
                                                 page   85
 
 
 
            validation files for the family must be created if they
            do not already exist.  This may be done by entering the
            following commands on the computer console:
 
                      X.DIS.
                      FAMILY(family name)
                      GENVAL.
                      DROP.
 
 
        2.  If you are using the default family, enter the following
            command:
                      X.MODVAL.
 
            Or, if you are using an alternate family device for the
            link files, enter the following command:
 
                      X.MODVAL(FM=fnam,OP=K)
 
        3.  The MODVAL job will then request the K-display.  Assign
            this display to the job by the following procedure:
 
            a.  Find the job which is requesting the K-display on
                the console B-display.
 
            b.  Note the job sequence number (JSN) of the job.  This
                is a four character identifier for the job.
 
            c.  Enter the following command on the computer console:
 
                      K,jsn.
 
        4.  Using the MODVAL options documented in the NOS Version 2
            Administration Handbook, create the following user
            names:
 
             a.  User name "PLASEND".  This name stores data that
                 is sent to other systems.
 
             b.  User name "PLARECV".  This name stores data that
                 is received from other systems.
 
        5.  The user names must have certain validations for
            security reasons. Unless otherwise noted, validations
            not mentioned are assumed to be site-specific.
 
            a.   You must set the following validations:
 
                 -  AW = CSPF, CCNR, CSRP, CSAP, CPLK, CUST, CSAF,
                         COPR, CNRD.
                 -  CC = 77B.
                 -  CP = 0.
                 -  CS = 7.
                 -  DB = 7.
                 -  DF = 77B.
                 -  DS = 0.
                 -  DT = 0.
 
                                                 page   86
 
 
 
                 -  EC = 0.
                 -  FC = 7.
                 -  FS = 7.
                 -  LP = 0.
                 -  MS = 77B.
                 -  MT = 0.
                 -  PT = 0.
                 -  RP = 7.
                 -  SL = 77B.
                 -  TL = 77B.
                 -  UC = BCCT, RBCT, IACT.
                 -  VM = ALL.
 
            b.   Choose a password, and set both user names to use
                 this password.  The user names MUST have identical
                 passwords.  This password is the key to controlling
                 access from other systems.  You must exchange
                 passwords with the administrators of the remote
                 site when you wish to permit inter-system data
                 transfers.
 
            c.   If you wish to set a default charge number for
                 accounting purposes, you should do so at this time
                 as described in the PLATO Configuration Handbook.
 
        3.7.3    Modify network configuration file
 
        Now you need to set up your NOS communication network.  To
        establish a connection to another system, you need to define
        a path through NAM's network configuration file and RHP's
        logical identifier (LID) table.  This procedure and other
        details about the installation and operation of these
        applications can be found in the following references:
 
            NOS Version 2 Feature Notes
            NOS Version 2 Installation Handbook          (60459320)
            NOS Version 2 Analysis Handbook              (60459300)
            Network Definition Language Reference Manual (60480000)
 
        Follow these steps:
 
        1.  Update your NOS level communication network.
 
            a.   Update the LID configuration file.  Refer to the
                 the NOS Version 2 Analysis Handbook for examples.
                 You need to specify a LID for your system -- we
                 suggest you use your routing identifier as specified
                 by the "rid" PLATO configuration file keyword.  You
                 will also need to add PIDs and LIDs for all the
                 other systems in your network.  You will need to
                 share this information with the administrators of
                 other sites.
 
            b.   Update your NDL file with changes necessary to run
                 the RHP applications.  Here are some examples of
                 NDL entries you will need to make:

                 Refer to the NOS Version 2 Feature Notes for more
                 examples.
 
            c.   Build your new network configuration file and
                 corresponding local configuration file using the
                 NDLP system command.  Refer to the Network
                 Definition Language Reference Manual for examples.
 
            d.   Update your current NAM start-up file with the new
                 NAM start-up file that was created with the RHP
                 build process.  Also, please make sure that the
                 following NOS files are moved to the same user
                 index as the NAM start-up file:
 
                      ZZPTFS
                      ZZQTFS
 
                                                 page   88
 
 
 
 
            e.   Bring down NAM, then reload NAM using the new
                 configuration files.
 
        2.  Your NOS communication network is now updated.  Be sure
            to test your network.
 
        3.7.4    Modify PLATO network system table
 
        You now need to update the PLATO network system table,
        which includes descriptions of the links between your
        system and other systems, and the options available to
        each link.
 
        First, you must modify the network system table entry for
        your own system as follows:
 
            a.   Sign on to PLATO with your "p" signon.
 
            b.   Execute lesson "ipedit".
 
            c.   Choose the "Network Management" option.
 
            d.   Choose the "System Table" option.  This takes you
                 to the "Network System Table Management" display.
 
            e.   Choose the "Inspect or change a table entry" option.
 
            f.   On the next display, enter your system name and
                 press NEXT.  This name is the same as that specified
                 by the "sid" PLATO configuration file keyword.
 
            g.   Choose the "Network Type:" option.
 
            h.   Choose the "Directly connected by 2550" option.
                 The display will replot and show a number of
                 additional options.
 
            i.   Choose the "NAM mainframe number" option.  Enter
                 the number of the mainframe that executes the NAM
                 application.  On most systems this will be the
                 default value of 0.
 
            j.   Choose the "Family name:" option.  Enter the NOS
                 family name that you set up to send and receive
                 data.  If you wish to use the default family,
                 simply press NEXT.
 
            k.   Choose the "User name password:" option.  Enter the
                 the password that you assigned to the user names
                 PLASEND and PLARECV.  The password entered MUST
                 be the one entered for both user names earlier in
                 the installation process.  There is no default.
 
            l.   Choose the "Charge number:" option.  If you will
                 not be using NOS charge numbers, or, if you plan to
                 use the default charge number you specified for the
 
                                                 page   89
 
 
 
                 PLARECV/PLASEND user names, press NEXT.  If you
                 want to account for each system's usage, enter a
                 charge number here.  Refer to the "Link Accounting"
                 section of this document for details.
 
            m.   You may wish to store the sending and receiving
                 data files on an auxiliary pack because of space
                 constraints on your "system" pack.  If so, choose
                 the "Pack name:" option and enter the desired NOS
                 pack name.  If you are using the default pack,
                 press NEXT.
 
            n.   If you chose to store your files on an auxiliary
                 pack, choose the "Pack device type:" option and
                 enter the device type of the pack you entered.  The
                 default is 'dl'.
 
            o.   Press BACK to return to the "Network System Table
                 Management" index.
 
        You should now use the procedure described in the "Adding a
        system" section of the PLATO Configuration Guide to add new
        systems or use the same procedure, selecting the "Inspect or
        change a table entry" option in place of the "Add a new system
        to the table" option on the "Network System Table Management"
        index, to modify existing systems to establish a link.
 
        3.7.5    Create system-specific files
 
        If the following required, system-specific files do not
        exist on your system, you should now create them in account
        "s0files" according to the specifications given in the
        PLATO Bill of Materials section.  Because "s0linkdata" has
        a ten-character name, you must use lesson "operator" to
        create it as "accounts" will not allow you to create files
        with more than eight characters in the name.
 
                 s0linkdata
                 s0notesq
                 s0rhpds
                 s0rhplog
                 s0rhpns
                 3netinq
                 3netoutq
 
        3.7.6    Install runner programs
 
        Now you need to set up a runner which will execute the
        PLATO lesson which looks for link traffic.  Follow these
        steps:
 
            a.   Sign on to the system with your group "p" signon.
 
            b.   Execute lesson "runnersys".
 
            c.   Choose the option to "Add lesson to list".
 
 
                                                 page   90
 
 
 
            d.   On the next display, enter the lesson name "s0rhp".
 
            e.   On the next display, choose the "cycle" option and
                 enter a cycle time of 5 minutes.
 
            f.   No other options need be set, unless you have some
                 specific site requirements.
 
            g.   On the same display, press SHIFT-LAB to make the
                 runner active.
 
            h.   Use the same procedure to add lessons "pnotes",
                 "s0notrun" and "account4" to the runner list.  These
                 lessons distribute personal notes and group notes
                 received from remote systems to the appropriate files
                 and perform file requests made by users through
                 the network features of lesson "accounts".  Use
                 the attributes listed in the "Runner Lesson Management"
                 section of the PLATO Operations Guide when adding
                 these lessons.
 
            i.   Press SHIFT-STOP to return to the Author Mode page.
 
        The installation of the PLATO Inter-system Link optional
        feature is now complete.
 
        3.8    PLATO-BITNET Email Gateway
 
        Before you install the non-PLATO mail system, you must
        install both the PLATO and NJEF applications.
 
        The following is a list of steps to be taken to install
        non-PLATO mail.  Each of the numbered steps is discussed in
        detail in the following sections:
 
        1. Decide upon a BITNET node name for your system.
 
        2. Decide upon the name for your mailer.
 
        3. Register with the BITNET operations organization.
 
        4. Connect your system to the BITNET network.
 
        5. Install the PLATO application on your operating system.
 
        6. Install the NJEF application.
 
        7. Define all (or a subset) of the BITNET nodes to the NJEF
        application.
 
        8. Create the mailer user name.
 
        9. Create required system-specific files.
 
        10. Define parameters in "s0bitsys".
 
        11. Install the required runner programs.
 
                                                 page   91
 
 
 
 
        12. Customize access lists.
 
        13. Define networks in "s0bitsys".
 
        14. Define nodes in "s0bitsys".
 
        3.8.1    Choose BITNET node name
 
        You must choose a name for your system to be known by in
        the non-PLATO world.  This name must be 8 characters or
        less in length.  One possibility is to use your PLATO
        system name (such as "pca" or "pdev") as your system name.
        This approach will allow you to use the same machine name
        in both the PLATO and non-PLATO worlds.
 
        3.8.2    Choose mailer name
 
        The non-PLATO mail software operates as a mailer.  A mailer
        is a program and receives and distributes mail for a
        machine.  You must choose a user name for this mailer.  By
        convention, this user name should be MAILER.
 
        3.8.3    Register with BITNET
 
        You must register your system with the BITNET Network
        Information Center before connecting to the network.  Among
        the pieces of information you'll need to supply are the
        node name and mailer name you chose above.
 
        3.8.4    Connect with BITNET
 
        Physically connect your system to the BITNET network via
        the appropriate hardware.
 
        3.8.5    Install PLATO application
 
        See other sections of this document as appropriate.
 
        3.8.6    Install NJEF application
 
        See the NJEF Installation Handbook (part number 15190118)
        for details.
 
        3.8.7    Define BITNET nodes
 
        Instructions for this are in the NJEF Installation
        Handbook.
 
        3.8.8    Create mailer user name
 
        Create an NOS user name for your mailer.  This name should
        be the same name you choose in step 2 above.
 
        3.8.9    Create system-specific files
 
        If the following required, system-specific files do not
 
                                                 page   92
 
 
 
        exist on your system, you should now create them in account
        "s0files" according to the specifications given in the
        PLATO Bill of Materials section.
 
                  s0bitparam
                  s0emailds
                  s0emailns
 
        3.8.10    Define parameters in s0bitsys
 
        Execute lesson "s0bitsys" and choose the "Change Network
        Parameters" option.  Set the options as follows:
 
                  BITNET mailer NOS name:       the NOS user name
                                                of your MAILER
                  BITNET mailer NOS family:     the NOS family the
                                                MAILER name appears
                                                under
                  Runner Delay:                 10 minutes
                  BITNET mail is enabled:       YES
                  Default network:              bitnet
                  BITNET system name:           the name chosen in
                                                step 1
 
        3.8.11    Install runner program
 
        Now you need to set up a runner which will execute the
        PLATO lesson that looks for non-PLATO mail.  Follow these
        steps:
 
             a. Sign on to the system with your group "p" signon.
 
             b. Execute lesson "runnersys".
 
             c. Choose the option to "Add lesson to list".
 
             d. On the next display, enter the lesson name
        "s0emrec".
 
             e. On the next display, set both the "cycle" and
        "restart" times to 1 minute.
 
             f. No other options need to be set, unless you have
        some specific site requirements.
 
             g. On the same display, press SHIFT-LAB to make the
        runner active.
 
             h. Press SHIFT-STOP to return to the Author Mode page.
 
        3.8.12    Customize access lists
 
        Edit access list "s0bitsys" in file "s0sysfile".  This
        access list controls:
 
             Who can execute lessons "s0bitsys" and "s0emrec"
        directly.  Only people in group "p" should have these
 
                                                 page   93
 
 
 
        abilities.
 
             Who can use the non-PLATO mail facility.  You'll need
        to keep in mind restrictions on usage imposed by the BITNET
        Operations Organization.
 
             Who can send to nodes that aren't explicitly defined
        in "s0bitsys".
 
             Who can override the access list for a node.
 
             Who can override the access list for a network.
 
        3.8.13    Define networks in s0bitsys
 
        Every network that you'll be exchanging mail with needs to
        be explicitly defined in "s0bitsys".  If a network isn't
        listed there, you won't be able to access it.  Follow these
        steps to add a network:
 
             a. Execute lesson "s0bitsys".
 
             b. Choose the option to "Create a New Network Entry."
 
             c. Set the "Network Name on PLATO" to the name you
        want this network known by to PLATO users.  Some examples
        of possible network names are "arpa", "edu" and "uucp".
 
             d. Set the "Node of BITNET gateway" to the BITNET node
        name of the system that is functioning as the gateway
        between the BITNET network and the network you are
        defining.
 
             e. Set the "BITNET mailer name" to the name of the
        mailer program on the gateway system.
 
             f. If the mailer on the gateway requires mail to have
        a Basic Simple Mail Transfer Protocol header, set the
        "BSMTP required" option to YES.
 
             g. If you want to limit access to this network, create
        an access list to do this.  The access list should be
        copied from "s0subfil".
 
             h. Set the address of this network in relation to the
        BITNET network.
 
        3.8.14    Define nodes in s0bitsys
 
        It is possible to define nodes as well as networks in
        "s0bitsys".  Defining nodes allows users to reach them
        using the shorthand names you define, or permits
        restriction of access by node. (See 3.8.12, though.)
        It is suggested that nodes frequently accessed by users on
        your PLATO system be defined.  Follow these steps to add a
        network:
 
 
                                                 page   94
 
 
 
             a. Execute lesson "s0bitsys".
 
             b. Choose the option to "Create a New Node Entry."
 
             c. Set the "Node Name on PLATO" to the name you want
        this node known by to PLATO users.  This should be the same
        as the node name in the non-PLATO world.  You might want to
        create multiple entries for a node:  One entry using the
        'official' name for the node, one using a local or
        shorthand name.
 
             d. Set the "BITNET node name" to the BITNET node name
        of the node that you are defining.
 
             e. Set the "BITNET mailer name" to the name of the
        mailer program (if any) on the new node.
 
             f. Set the "Default Network" to the name of the
        network on which the node you are defining resides.
 
             g. If you want to limit access to this node, create an
        access list to do this.  The access list should be copied
        from "s0subfil".
 
             h.  Set the address of this node in relation to the
        network on which it resides.

        INTRODUCTION
 
        The following sections describe the procedure to be followed
        to update your PLATO system from one major release to another
        (for example, from PLATO Release 43 to PLATO Release 44).
        If you are only upgrading your operating system and wish to
        reinstall the same PLATO Release level on it, you should use
        the "Reinstallation Procedures" section instead of this one.
 
        If the PLATO Release you are updating to requires a different
        level of the operating system, it is assumed that it has already
        been installed.
 
        When updating to a new level of the operating system, the
        following PLATO-related items must be carried over from the
        old operating system deadstart file to the new one.
 
            1. Changes to deadstart file text records (CMRDECKs,
               EQPDECKs, LIBDECKs, IPRDECKs) as described in the
               "Deadstart File" section of the PLATO Configuration
               Handbook.
 
            2. Procedure MFNX.
 
            3. Procedure MFDX.
 
            4. Procedure SETPUN.
 
            5. Procedure Z1DAILY.
 
            6. Procedure Z1ENDBC.
 
            7. The PLATO configuration file.
 
        If there are changes required to the above for the new PLATO
        release, they will be described in the "Change deadstart
        file text records" section of the following procedure.  Do
        not carry over any PLATO binaries or procedures other than
        the ones listed above from one operating system to another.
 
        This update installation procedure is designed to allow
        analysts to upgrade their system from PLATO release 35
        or higher to the current release.
 
        Each section which is dependent on the PLATO Release which
        is currently running has a separate list of changes required
        for each release.  To use these update installation procedures,
        you must start with the list describing the changes for the
        PLATO release immediately following the release level currently
        running on your system and proceed through all lists of changes
        up to and including the release level being installed.
 
        For example, if you are currently running release level 43
        and you wish to upgrade to level 44, you should use only the
        list of changes for PLATO R44 in each section.  If your
        system is currently running at release level 42 and you wish
        to upgrade to release level 44, you must use the list of

        4.1    PLATO Operations Changes
 
        The following describes major changes to the operation or
        installation of the PLATO application.  This is included to
        inform analysts performing the upgrade installation of the
        PLATO application of important changes in operational
        procedures.

        4.2.1    Execute pre-installation cleanups.
 
        There are several checkouts and cleanups that should be
        done as part of normal operations.  The procedures in the
        following sections should be done before the installation
        to resolve possible existing problems and to minimize the
        cleanups necessary after installation.
 
 
            1. Execute the following cleanup programs in lesson
               "accountu" for all accounts.  Errors are logged in
               "accerrlog".
 
               a. "Account directory and file checks"
 
               b. "Search for files not in any account"
 
            2. Execute the "Search for duplicate files" option in
               lesson "installu" for all active master files.
 
            3. Execute the "File Directory Verification Check" option
               in lesson "utility".  If the "utility" runner is turned
               on, it should not be necessary to run this manually.
 
            4. If any errors are found as a result of these checks,
               they will be logged.  Print the corresponding log file
               and correct any errors before proceeding.
 
            5. A new software release will usually require more disk
               space.  The amount required may vary from a few parts
               to over a hundred.  Make sure there is adequate space
               on your required master files to handle the new soft-
               ware.  This may involve adding another master file to
               your system if you are currently at or close to the
               limit of available space.
 
            6. During the installation process, a temporary master
               file must be loaded onto your disk packs.  You must
               make sure there is enough disk space available on
               your disk packs to create one 3680-part master file.
               The number of free tracks required for this master
               file is shown below for each supported device type.
               In addition, there must also be half as many tracks
               of temporary file space available.  The following
               table gives the number of free tracks assuming you
               are using single-spindle devices.  If you are using
               multi-spindle devices, divide the required free tracks
               by the number of spindles in the device to be used.
 
                      DC         270b tracks
                      DD        1445b tracks
                      DG         344b tracks
                      DI        2264b tracks
                      DJ        1067b tracks
                      DK        2176b tracks
                      DL        1067b tracks

            7. When installing PLATO Release 35 or above, you may
               need to lengthen common "link" in file "sysfile"
               before beginning the installation.  Use the following
               procedure to determine if you will need to lengthen
               this common.
 
               a. Edit file "sysfile".
 
               b. Press "+" until you find the block named "link".
 
               c. Press the letter which appears next to block "link"
                  to edit it.
 
               d. Near the top of the next display, you will see the
                  current length of the common displayed.
 
               e. If this length is greater than (1 + 10 * the value
                  of the "netms" configuration file entry), you will
                  not need to lengthen this common.
 
               If the current length of the common is too short, you
               should use the following procedure to lengthen it.
 
               a. At a convenient time, back out all users.  This is
                  necessary to prevent a user from writing a common
                  into file "sysfile" while the file is reorganized.
 
               b. Edit file "sysfile".
 
               c. Press "+" until you find the block named "link".
 
               d. Press the letter which appears next to block "link"
                  to edit it.
 
               e. Press SHIFT-LAB for "other options".
 
               f. Choose the "change length of common" option.
 
               g. Choose a new length which is the lowest multiple of
                  320 greater than (1 + 10 * the value of the "netms"
                  configuration file entry).

        4.2.2    Obtain files from installation tape.
 
        This step will load the files which make up the PLATO
        application from the first installation tape.
 
        Mount the first installation tape (the one labeled PLAT1A)
        on an available tape drive.  Make sure the tape drive is
        available by checking the console E,T-display.
 
        Enter the following commands on the computer console:
 
                      X.DIS.
                      FAMILY(family name)  if using alternate family
                      USER(sys,password)   sys is the PLATO system
                                           user name (usually SYS)
                      LABEL(TAPE,VSN=PLAT1A)
                      GTR(TAPE,UPGRADE)PROC/UPGRADE
                      BEGIN(UPGRADE,UPGRADE,PPW=ps1,SPW=ps2)
 
                      where  ps1 = password for user name PLATOMF
                                   (default = "platomf")
                             ps2 = password for user name SYSTEMX
                                   (default = "systemx")
 
        This procedure creates or replaces the following files.
 
            User sys:      PLABINS   PLATO release binaries
                           PLANOS    modifications to NOS

        4.2.3    Reinstall NAM and CCP.
 
        If you are using only CDCNET, you do not need to do anything
        with CCP as discussed in this section.  You still may need
        to reinstall NAM.
 
        Inspect the contents of files PLANAM and PLACCP under the
        PLATO system user name.  If either of these files contains
        modsets, it will be necessary to reinstall NAM and CCP
        with these modsets.  Refer to the NOS Installation Handbook
        for instructions.
 
        The PLATO application requires only the standard asynchronous
        TIP in the CCP build procedure.
 
        Save any modsets in PLANAM and PLACCP so they may be used
        again if NAM and CCP must be reinstalled in the future.

        4.2.4    Reinstall selected NOS programs.
 
        Inspect the contents of file PLANOS under the PLATO system
        user name.  If this file contains modsets, it will be
        necessary to reinstall the affected programs with these
        modsets.  Refer to the NOS Installation Handbook for more
        information.
 
        By looking at the contents of this file, determine what NOS
        programs will need to be reassembled.  Only the programs
        which have modifications will need to be reassembled.
 
        Be sure that, any time in the future, when these programs
        are reassembled, that these modifications are included.
 
        Save the binaries produced for replacement on your deadstart
        file after all the PLATO materials are ready to be installed.
 
        Save any modsets in PLANOS so they may be used again if the
        affected NOS programs must be reinstalled in the future.

        4.2.5    Change NOS validation files.
 
        Changes to the format or content of the NOS validation files
        may affect the user names used by the PLATO application or
        by users of the PLATO application.
 
        You should make all changes listed for all NOS levels
        beginning with the one following the level you are updating
        from through the NOS level you are updating to.
 
 
        CHANGES FOR NOS 2.5.2 LEVEL 678
 
            There are no NOS validation file changes necessary
            for this NOS level.

        4.2.6    Change local deadstart file records.
 
        Changes in the format or content of the NOS deadstart file
        text records (CMRDECKs, EQPDECKs, LIBDECKs, IPRDECKs) or the
        local PLATO procedures MFNX, MFDX, SETPUN, Z1DAILY, and
        Z1ENDBC may be required because of changes in NOS or in the
        PLATO application software.
 
        This can be done using O26 or some other text editor available
        on your system.  Instructions for using O26 may be found in
        the NOS V2 System Programmer's Instant manual.
 
        Save the modified records for replacement on your deadstart
        file after all the PLATO materials are ready to be installed.
 
        The following example assumes you are using O26 as the text
        editor and that you are using the first (0) copies of the
        text records (CMRD00, EQPD00, LIBD00, IPRD00).

        4.2.6.1    Deadstart record changes
 
        CHANGES TO CMRDECKS
 
            The following change should be made to all CMRDECKs on
            the deadstart file.  If there are on-line copies of these

        4.2.9    Clear operator action queues.
 
        The format of various operator action queues may change
        with a new release.  Therefore, all requested actions should
        be performed just prior to the installation, thus clearing
        the queues.
 
        1.  Print all requests in the print request queue.
 
        2.  Perform any file backup requests.
 
        3.  Complete any archive/retrieval requests.

        Before you begin the installation, do a complete dump of
        all disk packs.  If something goes wrong, good backups must
        be available to allow retreating to the previous release,
        if necessary.

        4.2.12    Load release master files.
 
        Use the PLATO procedure LOADMF to copy the PLATO master
        files from the installation tapes to disk.
 
        The formats of this procedure call are:
 
                      LOADMF(MF=mf)               default family
 
                      LOADMF(MF=mf,FAMILY=fn)     alternate family
 
                      LOADMF(MF=mf,PN=pn,R=dt)    auxiliary device
 
                 where:
 
                      mf  = master file name
                      fn  = family name
                      pn  = auxiliary pack name
                      dt  = device type if PN argument is used
 
        Mount each installation tape as it is requested via the
        E,P-display.
 
            Example:  Default family.
 
            If you are using the default family device for PLATO
            master files, enter the following on the computer console.
 
                      X.DIS.
                      USER(sys,password)

            Example:  Alternate family.
 
            If you are using an alternate family device for PLATO
            master files, enter the following on the computer console.
 
                      X.DIS.
                      USER(sys,password)

        4.2.13    Change MFNX procedure.
 
        Procedure MFNX must be changed to attach the new system
        lesson master file, SYS1.  This master file must be the
        first master file attached so that files on this master
        file which duplicate ones already on the system are used
        when the PLATO application is loaded.  You may also need to
        change or add a RESOURC command if the new master file will
        be on an auxiliary pack other than those already used by
        required master files.  DO NOT put this MFNX on your dead-
        start file, it is only to be SYSEDITed.
 
        In addition, check to be sure that the number of required
        master files PLUS the one installation master file does not
        exceed the value of the "ndsus" PLATO configuration file
        entry.  If necessary, obtain a copy of your configuration
        file from the deadstart file and edit it to increase "ndsus"
        as needed.  DO NOT put this configuration file on your dead-
        start file, it is only to be SYSEDITed.
 
        Use SYSEDIT to make these changes to MFNX and the PLATO
        configuration file part of the running system.
 
        You may use a procedure similar to the following to make
        these changes to MFNX and your PLATO configuration file.
 
                      X.DIS.
                      COMMON(SYSTEM)

                      *  local file MFNX.  Use O26 to edit file MFNX
                      *  to attach new master files.

                      *  entry in local file CONFIG, if necessary.

        4.2.14    Load PLATO via PLAINS.
 
        You will now load the PLATO application via the PLAINS
        DSD-command.
 
        1.   If your system is to use the PLATO ASCII network, NAM
             must be brought up at this point.
 
        2.  Load the PLATO application by typing the following at
            the computer console:
 
                      PLAINS.
 
 
            This console command is used only during PLATO application
            installations.  It performs the following functions:
 
            a.  Alters the "cpspd" configuration entry so that the
                PLATO application will allow more foreground processing
                time for running installation programs.
 
            b.  Prevents groups other than "s", "p" and "convertc"
                from signing onto the system.
 
            When updating from PLATO release 34.1 or earlier, you
            may see the dayfile message "network table obsolete".
            This message may be ignored during installation since
            the problem being reported will be corrected by a
            conversion to the network system table later in this
            process.
 
        3.  Now, sign on to the PLATO application with a PLATO
            terminal, using your "p" sign-on.

        4.2.15    Change existing access lists.
 
        The PLATO application uses several access lists to control
        user access to privileged system lessons and options.  These
        access lists are maintained by the local system.  Sometimes
        changes must be made to these access lists at the time of
        the installation of a new PLATO release.
 
        The following general procedure can be used to update these
        access lists.
 
            1.  Edit file "s0sysfile".
 
            2.  Press "+" until the name of the access list to be
                updated is seen on the block display of the editor.
 
            3.  Edit the access list which must be updated by
                pressing the letter which appears next to the name
                of the access list on the block display.
 
            4.  Select the "edit user option descriptions" option.
 
            5.  Now, select the "copy descriptions from another
                access list" option.
 
            6.  Enter "s0subfil" as the name of the file from which
                to copy.
 
            7.  Enter the name of the access list to be updated as
                the block from which to copy.
 
            8.  Press "y" to adjust authorizations.  (If this is not
                done, all entries in the access list will be of type
                "Special", instead of "Director" or "Operator", etc.).
 
            9.  Press SHIFT-HELP to copy the descriptions.
 
            10. Any sign-on listed in the access list which was
                previously of type "Special" still retains that
                classification.  You may want to check the individual
                options assigned to that sign-on, and possibly change
                some of them.

        4.2.16    Change existing PLATO files.
 
        For each new PLATO release, there may be changes needed for
        existing system database files.
 
 
        4.2.16.1    Change existing PLATO files.
 
        CHANGES FOR PLATO R41
 
            With this release of the PLATO application, a new
            feature requires an addition of an access list to
            "s0sysfile".  Follow the steps below to complete
            this process.
 
                1. Edit file "s0sysfile".
 
                2. Choose to add a new block to this file by pressing
                   the SHIFTed letter of the block you want the new
                   block to follow.  You may have to lengthen "s0sysfile"
                   through accounts options if there is not enough room
                   to add new blocks.
 
                3. Choose the option to copy blocks from another file.
 
                4. Enter "s0subfil" as the file to copy from.
 
                5. Choose the block named "s0bitsys" which has the
                   characters "ac" next to it as the block to copy.
                   You may get a message at this point which indicates
                   there is not enough space in the file to copy all
                   of the blocks.  If this happens, lengthen the file
                   through account options and start this procedure
                   over at step 1.
 
                6. After the blocks are copied, press BACK until you
                   are out of the file.

        4.2.17    Destroy obsolete files.
 
        With each release, there are certain files which become
        obsolete and are no longer needed.  These files should be
        destroyed to save space.  This is done through lesson
        "transfer" as follows:
 
            1.  Execute lesson "transfer".
 
            2.  Choose the "Destroy Obsolete System Courseware"
                option.
 
            3.  Choose "obsolete system files".
 
            4.  Press SHIFT-HELP to begin the operation.
 
            5.  Enter the name of a student datafile to use as an
                error log or press NEXT to use the default log file
                when requested.
 
            5.  If a particular file did not exist on the system, it
                will be automatically skipped and entered into the
                error log along with any other error that may have
                occurred.  If log entries were made, the log should
                be scanned to see if anything unusual happened.
 
        In addition to the lessons above, which are destroyed
        automatically, you may also destroy file "s0leslst", if it
        exists on your system, using account file management options.

        4.2.18    Install new system lessons.
 
        Install new versions of system lessons as follows:
 
            1.  Execute lesson "transfer".
 
            2.  Choose the "install new courseware" option.
 
            3.  Enter "sys1" and press NEXT.
 
            4.  You will be asked for the name of the first file to
                process.  Press NEXT to begin with the first file on
                the master file.
 
            5.  Press "n" to specify that customer files are NOT to
                be replaced.
 
            6.  Press "n" to specify that errors are NOT to be
                automatically skipped.
 
            7.  Old system files will be automatically destroyed if
                they are to be replaced.  If a new file duplicates
                a file found in a non-system account, "transfer"
                will stop.  The file in the non-system account must
                be renamed.
 
            8.  If an error occurs, a message will be displayed.
                Correct the problem reported and continue.  There
                should be no errors if the account cleanup programs
                were run prior to the installation.
 
            9.  It may be necessary to increase the number of disk
                parts allocated to account "system" during this
                installation.  If so, set the parts allocated to
                unlimited.

        4.2.19    Initialize binary master file(s).
 
        All binary master files should be reinitialized.  While the
        system will still function properly without doing this, the
        "utility" runner program will generate errors for any old
        binary file it finds.
 
            1. Execute lesson "ldr".
 
            2. Choose the "Master File Initializations" option.
 
            3. Enter the binary master file name.
 
            4. Press NEXT to leave the master file name the same.
 
            5. Press NEXT to leave the master file type the same.
 
            6. Press "y" to initialize all files on the master file.
 
            7. Press SHIFT-HELP to initialize the master file.
 
            8. Repeat this procedure for all binary master files.

        4.2.20    Reload PLATO.
 
        All new system files have now been transferred to the
        required master files.  Therefore, master file SYS1
        is no longer needed.  Reload without it as follows:
 
            1.  Take the PLATO application down.
 
            2.  Enter the following at the computer console to
                restore procedure MFNX and the PLATO configuration
                file to their original state.
 
                      X.SYSEDIT(R)
 
            3.  Reload the PLATO application again using the PLAINS
                DSD command.

        4.2.21    Run required conversion programs.
 
        For some releases, conversion programs must be run to update
        user files so that they will work on the new release of the
        application.  The conversions which must be run for this
        release are described below.  Unless told otherwise below,
        run the conversions according to the procedures described
        in the "File Conversions" section of the PLATO Operations
        Guide.
 
        If there are no conversion programs to be run or after all
        conversion programs are run, you must make sure that the
        update levels of new files are being set correctly.  This
        is done as follows:
 
            1.  Execute lesson "ipedit".
 
            2.  Press NEXT on the first display for other options.
 
            3.  Select the "Update levels for new files" option.
 
            4.  Check the list of file types and update levels with
                the list below.  The update levels of file types not
                listed below should be zero.
 
                          File type      Update level
                              a               5
                              f               6
                              g               1
                              h               2
                              i               2
                              k               1
                              l               2
                              o               2
                              q               1
 
            4.  If there are any differences, enter the file type and
                the new update level.  Update levels will always
                increase, do not change an update level to a lower
                value.

        4.2.22    Run file installation check.
 
        All system lessons have now been replaced with the new
        versions for this release.  Test for proper installation
        as follows:
 
            1.  Execute lesson "installu".
 
            2.  Choose "Special lesson list check" option.

        INTRODUCTION
 
        The following sections describe the procedure to be followed
        to update your PLATO system when you receive a "mini-release"
        shipment.  Mini-release shipments are used to distribute
        fixes for critical problems which cannot wait until the next
        major release.
 
        This procedure may be used to update from any mini-release
        version of the PLATO system to any other.  Make sure you
        follow any special instructions included with the mini-
        release shipment as well as the procedure described here.
 
 
        The following is a list of the steps to be taken to install
        a mini-release of the PLATO application software.  Each of
        these steps is discussed in detail in the following sections.
 
             1. Obtain files from mini-release binaries tape.
 
             2. Perform special instructions.
 
             3. Build new deadstart file.
 
             4. Load mini-release master file.
 
             5. Deadstart on new deadstart file.
 
             6. Load PLATO via PLAINS DSD-command.
 
             7. Change existing PLATO files.
 
             8. Initialize binary master file(s).
 
             9. Post-installation cleanups.
 
            10. Reload PLATO.
 
                                                 page  139
 
 
 
 
        5.1    Obtain files from installation tape.
 
        This step will load the files which make up the PLATO
        application from the mini-release binaries tape.
 
        Mount the first installation tape (the one labeled PLAT1A)
        on an available tape drive.  Make sure the tape drive is
        available by checking the console E,T-display.
 
        Enter the following commands on the computer console:
 
                      X.DIS.
                      FAMILY(family name)  if using alternate family
                      USER(sys,password)   sys is the PLATO system
                                           user name (usually SYS)
                      LABEL(TAPE,VSN=PLAT1A)
                      GTR(TAPE,UPGRADE)PROC/UPGRADE
                      BEGIN(UPGRADE,UPGRADE,PPW=ps1,SPW=ps2)
 
                      where  ps1 = password for user name PLATOMF
                                   (default = "platomf")
                             ps2 = password for user name SYSTEMX
                                   (default = "systemx")
 
        This procedure creates or replaces the following files.
 
            User sys:      PLABINS   PLATO release binaries
                           PLANOS    modifications to NOS

                           PLACCP    modifications to CCP
                           PLARHP    modifications to RHP

        5.2    Perform special instructions.
 
        The following may be changed by a specific mini-release,
        but are not generally needed for all mini-releases.  Make
        these changes only if told to do so in the mini-release memo
        included with the mini-release tapes or in the PLATO Software
        Release Bulletin.
 
             a. Reinstall NAM and CCP.
 
             b. Reinstall selected NOS programs.
 
             c. Change PLATO configuration file.
 
                                                 page  141
 
 
 
 
        5.3    Build new deadstart file.
 
        Build a new deadstart file which includes the PLATO binaries
        which were loaded from the installation tape earlier in this
        procedure and any items changed under the section on special
        instructions.
 
        The following is a sample procedure which could be used to
        build the deadstart file.
 
                      X.DIS.
                      FAMILY(family name)  if using alternate family
                      USER(sys,password)
                      COMMON(SYSTEM)
                      ATTACH(PLABINS)
                      UNLOAD(DIR)
                      NOTE(DIR,NR).*FILE PLABINS
                      PACK(DIR)
                      REWIND(*)
                      LIBEDIT(P=SYSTEM,I=DIR)
                      REWIND(*)
                      ASSIGN,50,T,F=I.   or   INSTALL(NEW=EQxx)
                      COPY(NEW,T,V)
 
                                                 page  142
 
 
 
 
        5.4    Load mini-release master files.
 
        Load the mini-release master file tapes as described in the
        "Courseware Installation" section of the PLATO Operations
        Guide.
 
        You must be sure that no users are signed in while this
        installation is being done.  Since system files are being
        replaced, users may begin using the new files before the
        installation is complete and results are unpredictable.
 
        When the installation is complete, take the PLATO system
        down.

        5.5    Deadstart on new deadstart file.
 
        Deadstart using the new deadstart file.

        5.6    Load PLATO via PLAINS.
 
        You will now load the PLATO application via the PLAINS
        DSD-command.
 
        1.  If your system is to use the PLATO ASCII network, NAM
            must be brought up at this point.
 
        2.  Load the PLATO application by typing the following at
            the computer console:
 
                      PLAINS.
 
 
            This console command is only during PLATO application
            installations.  It performs the following functions:
 
            a.  Alters the "cpspd" configuration entry so that the
                PLATO application will allow more foreground processing
                time for running installation programs.
 
            b.  Prevents groups other than "s", "p" and "convertc"
                from signing onto the system.
 
            When updating from PLATO release 34.1 or earlier, you
            may see the dayfile message "network table obsolete".
            This message may be ignored during installation since
            the problem being reported will be corrected by a
            conversion to the network system table later in this
            process.
 
        3.  Now, sign on to the PLATO application with a PLATO
            terminal, using your "p" sign-on.

        5.7    Change existing PLATO files.
 
        The following may be changed by a specific mini-release,
        but are not generally needed for all mini-releases.  Make
        these changes only if told to do so in the mini-release memo
        included with the mini-release tapes or in the PLATO Software
        Release Bulletin.
 
             a. Change existing access lists.
 
             b. Change existing PLATO database files.

        5.8    Initialize binary master file(s).
 
        All binary master files should be reinitialized.  While the
        system will still function properly without doing this, the
        "utility" runner program will generate errors for any old
        binary file it finds.
 
            1. Execute lesson "ldr".
 
            2. Choose the "Master File Initializations" option.
 
            3. Enter the binary master file name.
 
            4. Press NEXT to leave the master file name the same.
 
            5. Press NEXT to leave the master file type the same.
 
            6. Press "y" to initialize all files on the master file.
 
            7. Press SHIFT-HELP to initialize the master file.
 
            8. Repeat this procedure for all binary master files.

        5.9    Post-installation cleanups.
 
        The items listed below are things which may be done fol-
        lowing a PLATO reinstallation, but are not critical.  If
        you do not wish to do these cleanups now, continue on to
        the next section.
 
 
        PURGE INSTALLATION-ONLY DISK FILES
 
            The following NOS permanent files may be purged to save
            space since they are needed only during the installation
            process.

        INTRODUCTION
 
        The following sections describe the procedure to be followed
        to reinstall your PLATO system on a new level of the operating
        system.  If you are also upgrading your PLATO system to a new
        release level as well as upgrading your operating system, you
        should use the "Upgrade Installation Procedures" section instead
        of this one.
 
        When updating to a new level of the operating system, the
        following PLATO-related items must be carried over from the
        old operating system deadstart file to the new one.
 
            1. Changes to deadstart file text records (CMRDECKs,
               EQPDECKs, LIBDECKs, IPRDECKs) as described in the
               "Deadstart File" section of the PLATO Configuration
               Handbook.
 
            2. Procedure MFNX.
 
            3. Procedure MFDX.
 
            4. Procedure SETPUN.
 
            5. Procedure Z1DAILY.
 
            6. Procedure Z1ENDBC.
 
            7. The PLATO configuration file.

        The following is a list of the steps to be taken to reinstall
        the PLATO application software.  Each of these steps is
        discussed in detail in the following sections.
 
             1. Obtain files from installation tape.
 
             2. Reinstall NAM and CCP.
 
             3. Reinstall selected NOS programs.
 
             4. Change NOS validation files.
 
             5. Build new deadstart file.
 
             6. Deadstart on new deadstart file.
 
             7. Load PLATO via PLAINS.
 
             8. Initialize binary master file(s).
 
             9. Post-installation cleanups.
 
            10. Reload PLATO.

        6.1    Obtain files from installation tape.
 
        This step will load the files which make up the PLATO
        application from the first installation tape.
 
        Mount the first installation tape (the one labeled PLAT1A)
        on an available tape drive.  Make sure the tape drive is
        available by checking the console E,T-display.
 
        Enter the following commands on the computer console:
 
                      X.DIS.
                      FAMILY(family name)  if using alternate family
                      USER(sys,password)   sys is the PLATO system
                                           user name (usually SYS)
                      LABEL(TAPE,VSN=PLAT1A)
                      GTR(TAPE,UPGRADE)PROC/UPGRADE
                      BEGIN(UPGRADE,UPGRADE,PPW=ps1,SPW=ps2)
 
                      where  ps1 = password for user name PLATOMF
                                   (default = "platomf")
                             ps2 = password for user name SYSTEMX
                                   (default = "systemx")
 
        This procedure creates or replaces the following files.
 
            User sys:      PLABINS   PLATO release binaries
                           PLANOS    modifications to NOS

        6.2    Reinstall NAM and CCP.
 
        If you are using only CDCNET, you do not need to do anything
        with CCP as discussed in this section.  You still may need
        to reinstall NAM.
 
        Inspect the contents of files PLANAM and PLACCP under the
        PLATO system user name.  If either of these files contains
        modsets, it will be necessary to reinstall NAM and CCP
        with these modsets.  Refer to the NOS Installation Handbook
        for instructions.
 
        The PLATO application requires only the standard asynchronous
        TIP in the CCP build procedure.
 
        Save any modsets in PLANAM and PLACCP so they may be used
        again if NAM and CCP must be reinstalled in the future.
 
                                                 page  154
 
 
 
 
        6.3    Reinstall selected NOS programs.
 
        Inspect the contents of file PLANOS under the PLATO system
        user name.  If this file contains modsets, it will be
        necessary to reinstall the affected programs with these
        modsets.  Refer to the NOS Installation Handbook for more
        information.
 
        By looking at the contents of this file, determine what NOS
        programs will need to be reassembled.  Only the programs
        which have modifications will need to be reassembled.
 
        Be sure that, any time in the future, when these programs
        are reassembled, that these modifications are included.
 
        Save the binaries produced for replacement on your deadstart
        file after all the PLATO materials are ready to be installed.
 
        Save any modsets in PLANOS so they may be used again if the
        affected NOS programs must be reinstalled in the future.

        6.4    Change NOS validation files.
 
        Changes to the format or content of the NOS validation files
        may affect the user names used by the PLATO application or
        by users of the PLATO application.
 
        You should make all changes listed for all NOS levels
        beginning with the one following the level you are updating
        from through the NOS level you are updating to.
 
 
        CHANGES FOR NOS 2.5.2 LEVEL 678
 
            There are no NOS validation file changes necessary for
            this NOS level.

        6.5    Build new deadstart file.
 
        Build a new deadstart file which includes the following:
 
            1.  The NAM which was reinstalled with the modsets in
                file PLANAM, if any were present.
 
            2.  The NOS programs which were reinstalled with the
                modsets in file PLANOS, if any were present.
 
            3.  The PLATO release binaries which were loaded from
                the installation tape earlier in this procedure.
 
 
        The following is a sample procedure which could be used to
        build the deadstart file.
 
                      X.DIS.
                      FAMILY(family name)  if using alternate family
                      USER(sys,password)
                      COMMON(SYSTEM)
                      ATTACH(nam binary file)

        6.7    Load PLATO via PLAINS.
 
        You will now load the PLATO application via the PLAINS
        DSD-command.
 
        1.  If your system is to use the PLATO ASCII network, NAM
            must be brought up at this point.
 
        2.  Load the PLATO application by typing the following at
            the computer console:
 
                      PLAINS.
 
 
            This console command is used only during PLATO application
            installations.  It performs the following functions:
 
            a.  Alters the "cpspd" configuration entry so that the
                PLATO application will allow more foreground processing
                time for running installation programs.
 
            b.  Prevents groups other than "s", "p" and "convertc"
                from signing onto the system.
 
        3.  Now, sign on to the PLATO application with a PLATO
            terminal, using your "p" sign-on.

        6.8    Initialize binary master file(s).
 
        All binary master files should be reinitialized.  While the
        system will still function properly without doing this, the
        "utility" runner program will generate errors for any old
        binary file it finds.
 
            1. Execute lesson "ldr".
 
            2. Choose the "Master File Initializations" option.
 
            3. Enter the binary master file name.
 
            4. Press NEXT to leave the master file name the same.
 
            5. Press NEXT to leave the master file type the same.
 
            6. Press "y" to initialize all files on the master file.
 
            7. Press SHIFT-HELP to initialize the master file.
 
            8. Repeat this procedure for all binary master files.

        6.9    Post-installation cleanups.
 
        The items listed below are things which may be done fol-
        lowing a PLATO reinstallation, but are not critical.  If
        you do not wish to do these cleanups now, continue on to
        the next section.

        B0rid         The "authors" package uses a set of files for
                      each system for which an index exists.  there
                      is one file named "b0(routing id)" and one
                      or more files named "b0(routing id)(letter)".
                      These namesets are automatically created when
                      the "authors" package is initialized on a new
                      system and new ones may be created through the
                      "authors" director options.
                      For example, assume you are on system "abc" and
                      that you also have "authors" data for the "min"
                      and "bru" systems.  You would have the following
                      files:
 
                      a.  b0abc, b0abca, b0abcb, ....
                      b.  b0min, b0mina, b0minb, ....
                      c.  b0bru, b0brua, b0brub, ....
 
                      The actual number of files depends on the number
                      of authors on each system.  These database
                      files may be exchanged between systems through
                      the PLATO Inter-system Link or via tape.  Refer
                      to the PLATO Operations Guide for information
                      on how to do this.
